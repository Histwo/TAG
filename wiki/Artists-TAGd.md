### The Color Purple Cast
Every actor and actress in [*The Color Purple*](https://m.imdb.com/title/tt0088939/) movie, especially those in the [“God is Trying To Tell You Something” church scene](https://youtu.be/uEv_d6zAYHk?si=bHNF83PjKng8xpuG). Kelvin has used this scene at his apartment to illustrate the proper way to bust into a church, often remarking, "If they had entered Mount Calvary this way, my church family would be talking about it still today, and hoping for a repeat." He uses the video to deter people from traveling for work.
