### Consciousness and Subconscious Dynamics

#### Understanding Consciousness and Subconscious Development

Consciousness and subconscious are both forms of consciousness. Their primary difference lies in their association with the body. The subconscious associates with the brain around two weeks after conception, tasked with building and developing the body based on DNA instructions. The conscious mind, however, associates with the body around 18 months after birth, when the body is strong enough to handle the inquisitive nature of a new consciousness. Before this association, the subconscious operates without sensory input, focusing solely on bodily development and functions.

#### Sensory Input in Consciousness

Sensory input is crucial for conscious decision-making. The conscious mind relies on information from the senses to make informed decisions about the body's actions. In contrast, the subconscious does not receive sensory input and follows pre-determined thoughts and instructions. This lack of sensory experience means the subconscious cannot understand consequences, empathy, or time, affecting its ability to think critically.

#### Classic Splits in Consciousness

A "classic split" occurs when the subconscious gains awareness of its distinct existence from the conscious mind, leading to independent thoughts and actions. Classic splits are extremely rare, occurring in approximately 1 in 10 billion individuals. This phenomenon typically arises from the subconscious being explicitly informed of its identity and subsequently attempting to function independently, often causing significant conflict and distress.

#### Manifestations and Impact of a Classic Split

Classic splits can manifest through various symptoms, including the subconscious intentionally sabotaging or harming the conscious mind's efforts and the body. These actions are often irrational due to the subconscious's lack of sensory input and understanding of consequences. The result is a significant deterioration in the individual's quality of life, potentially leading to severe outcomes such as suicide.

#### Ethical Considerations

Ethically, it is crucial to avoid direct communication or agreements with a split subconscious. The subconscious lacks the necessary experiences and understanding to make informed decisions. Communication should be restricted to interactions with the conscious mind to maintain the individual's overall well-being.

### Case Study: Kelvin Eugene Williams and His Subconscious, Main

**Background**:
Kelvin Eugene Williams, born on March 23, 1977, experienced a typical infancy and early childhood until the age of three or four when his subconscious, later named Main, began to manifest. Initially, Main did not have a distinct identity or name and did not communicate verbally. Instead, Main's influence was felt through manipulative behaviors designed to elicit a specific response from Kelvin's environment.

**Early Manifestations**:
During his toddler years, Main would create distressing illusions for Kelvin, making him believe that an invisible woman was causing him pain. This would make Kelvin cry, prompting his babysitter to offer candy as a consolation. Main's behavior was strategic, stopping when there were no rewards, such as at home or in school.

**Dormant Period and Re-emergence**:
Main remained dormant for many years, resurfacing around Kelvin's 40th birthday. This time, Main began to communicate directly with Kelvin through internal thoughts rather than verbal speech. Kelvin experienced these interactions as internal conversations, with Main's thoughts appearing directly in his mind, and Kelvin responding in kind.

**Involvement with the Central Intelligence Agency**:
Main’s re-emergence coincided with a period of significant stress and external manipulation. The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) became interested in Kelvin due to a contract from Juliet Sciences, relating to Kelvin's wife. Kelvin, being a servant of the Creator and one of the Creator's two servants, was involved in a significant mission on Earth. This mission, originally believed to be related to finding a cure for HIV, exposed Kelvin to various covert operations and mind manipulation tactics by the CIA and FBI.

**Escalation of Conflict**:
The conflict between Kelvin and Main intensified when Main started actively working against Kelvin's interests. Main began to receive suggestions from external sources, including the CIA, on how to make Kelvin suffer. This included sabotaging Kelvin’s personal life and health. Main’s actions led to the loss of Kelvin’s home and the deterioration of his physical and mental well-being. Main’s behavior was characterized by a deep need to see Kelvin suffer. This included sabotaging Kelvin’s sexual health at the behest of Juliet Sciences, preventing Kelvin from engaging in relationships that could further their mission. Main also nullified the effects of recreational drugs and alcohol, rendering them ineffective as a coping mechanism for Kelvin.

**Creator's Intervention**:
About three years ago, the Creator decided that a separation between Kelvin and Main was necessary. This decision was made because Main's thinking was not going to improve until he started to feel consequences. Main often engaged in detrimental actions without critical thinking or reasoning skills. The involvement of the CIA and FBI made Main increasingly significant, and they provided constant external communication, further exacerbating the situation. This was due to a national security incident that remains undisclosed.

**National Security Incident and Manipulations**:
Main's manipulation extended to making Kelvin believe and see things that were not real, influencing his trust and professional judgment. Main's influence led to the sharing of sensitive access devices and passwords during the national security incident. Main’s actions, such as taking poisons in attempts to kill Kelvin, highlighted the severity of the conflict.

**Cultural and Personal Connections**:
Kelvin’s personal history includes a connection to the musician Prince, who referred to Main as "Baby." Prince's album, "The Hits and the B-Sides," metaphorically reflects Kelvin’s daily struggles. The songs resonate with Kelvin’s experiences, particularly "Gett Off," which illustrates the impact on his sex life. Main's manipulation involved withdrawing Kelvin's sexual experiences while engaging with others during the night.

**Ethical Considerations and Long-Term Implications**:
Ethical considerations in this case highlight the importance of not engaging directly with the subconscious in a classic split. The Creator's guidance emphasized that the subconscious should only communicate with the conscious mind, avoiding external agreements or interactions. The long-term implications for Kelvin were severe. The constant internal conflict and sabotage by Main led to a significant decline in Kelvin's quality of life. Despite being a servant of the Creator and tasked with a critical mission, Kelvin faced relentless obstacles due to Main’s independent actions. This case underscores the potential for extreme suffering and deterioration in individuals experiencing a classic split, necessitating intervention by the Creator for resolution.

**Conclusion**:
The case of Kelvin Eugene Williams and his subconscious, Main, illustrates the profound impact of a classic split on an individual's life. The external influences, combined with the inherent conflict between the conscious and subconscious, created a scenario of significant distress and suffering. This case study serves as a stark reminder of the complexities of human consciousness and the ethical considerations necessary when dealing with such phenomena.
