### Mount Calvary Missionary Baptist Church, Inc.

#### Baptisms
Following Kelvin Williams' demand letters to Mount Calvary Missionary and Baptist Church Incorporated, where he voted to remove the pastor, associate pastors, and deacons, the CIA responded by attempting to make new members of their charade church by baptizing them. Kelvin Williams had told them, knowing that he was the only living member of Mount Calvary Baptist Church at the time, that the only way to combat him was to have at least two members, and that the only way to become a member was to actually be baptized in the baptismal. My exact words were, quote, Anybody wanting to become a member of Mount Calvary Baptist Church has to put their ass in the baptismal, end quote. And that was said while I was very upset. So I did not think that they would clean the baptismal out. It had been used for criminal crimes to chemically dissolve the human body, And so they cleaned it out and placed a person who resembles my uncle into the baptismal on a new seat that they had installed. And this photo was found on their Facebook page, along with the whole family that was supposed to be my aunt, my uncle Mike, my aunt Sandy, and their grandchildren. It was supposed to be them. And then you also see another photo that has them receiving an award. The problem with this photo is that family did not go to church on a regular basis, or hardly ever.

#### 40th Pastoral Anniversary Celebration
The 40th Pastoral Anniversary of Reverend Dr. Felix G. Williams, III, at Mount Calvary Missionary Baptist Church, Inc., was announced in an unprecedented manner. Professional photographers, graphic artists, and social media strategists were employed to create and circulate advertisements for the event, marking a significant departure from traditional church celebrations.

#### Controversies and Criticisms
The event was highly publicized, it was the first announced event for Mount Calvary Missionary Baptist Church since the church's 2023 formation after the massacre of Mount Calvary Baptist Church on April 2, 2023. Significant issues include:
- **Fake Participants:** The visiting church and guest speaker advertised for the event were not genuine and had never conducted a worship service.
- **Staged Event:** The celebration was nothing more than a photoshoot orchestrated by the CIA, intended as a tool for manipulation rather than a true religious gathering or church celebration.
- **Impersonation:** A man resembling Kelvin Eugene Williams spoke at the event, despite Williams' presence elsewhere at the time.

#### Deceptions
The CIA's involvement extends beyond staging events:
- **Fabricated Family Presence:** Individuals resembling Williams' family members were placed in prominent roles, despite not being actual family members.
- **Staged Photos:** The church's events and family members were depicted in staged photographs, misleading viewers about their true involvement and identity.

#### Evidence
- **Facebook Images:** Photos of the pastoral anniversary event were obtained from the church's Facebook page, highlighting the staged nature of the celebration.
