Following Kelvin Williams' letter expressiconcern to Rev. Dr. Felix G. Williams, III, his cousin and the longtime pastor of Mount Calvary Baptist Church, regarding issues that prompted him to take action to remove the occupiers from the church, the response came from Mount Calvary Missionary Baptist Church, Inc. Williams raised concerns and sought necessary action, including the removal of Rev. Dr. Felix G. Williams, III, along with the associate pastors and deacons. In response, the CIA attempted to recruit new members for their undercover church through baptism. Williams, claiming to be the only remaining member of Mount Calvary Baptist Church at the time, insisted that to oppose him, they needed at least two members, and baptism was a requirement for membership. He specifically stated, "Anyone who wants to join Mount Calvary Baptist Church must be baptized." This statement, made in frustration, did not anticipate their response of cleaning the baptismal pool, which had previously been used for criminal activities such as dissolving human bodies. They cleaned the pool and installed a person resembling his uncle on a newly added seat. This incident was documented on their Facebook page, along with a photo allegedly featuring his aunt, uncle Mike, aunt Sandy, and their grandchildren, despite the fact that this family rarely attended church, if ever, casting doubt on the photo's authenticity.

The 40th Pastoral Anniversary of Reverend Dr. Felix G. Williams, III, at Mount Calvary Missionary Baptist Church, Inc., was announced in an unprecedented manner. Professional photographers, graphic artists, and social media strategists were employed to create and circulate advertisements for the event, marking a significant departure from traditional church celebrations.

#### Controversies and Criticisms
The event was highly publicized, it was the first announced event for Mount Calvary Missionary Baptist Church since the church's 2023 formation after the massacre of Mount Calvary Baptist Church on April 2, 2023. Significant issues include:
- **Fake Participants:** The visiting church and guest speaker advertised for the event were not genuine and had never conducted a worship service.
- **Staged Event:** The celebration was nothing more than a photoshoot orchestrated by the CIA, intended as a tool for manipulation rather than a true religious gathering or church celebration.
- **Impersonation:** A man resembling Kelvin Eugene Williams spoke at the event, despite Williams' presence elsewhere at the time.

#### Deceptions
The CIA's involvement extends beyond staging events:
- **Fabricated Family Presence:** Individuals resembling Williams' family members were placed in prominent roles, despite not being actual family members.
- **Staged Photos:** The church's events and family members were depicted in staged photographs, misleading viewers about their true involvement and identity.

#### Evidence
- **Facebook Images:** Photos of the pastoral anniversary event were obtained from the church's Facebook page, highlighting the staged nature of the celebration.
