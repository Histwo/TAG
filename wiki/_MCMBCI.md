# Mount Calvary Missionary Baptist Church, Inc.

## Overview
Mount Calvary Missionary Baptist Church, Inc. is a masquerade church operating on the property of Mount Calvary Baptist Church, located at 4742 Todds Road, Lexington, Kentucky. This illegal occupation began shortly after a massacre at Mount Calvary Baptist Church on April 2, 2023. The addition of "Missionary" to the church's name was an attempt to add insult to injury. Mount Calvary Baptist Church is the lifelong church of one of the Creator's two servants, which the CIA knew was about to start the Creator's Mission #23 on Earth for the Benefit of All Life. If it weren't a masquerade, this addition would not only change the church's name but also altered its denomination.

## Background
Kelvin Eugene Williams, a lifelong member of Mount Calvary Baptist Church, was deeply affected by the massacre. Upon viewing photos and videos posted on the Mount Calvary Missionary Baptist Church’s Facebook page, he immediately wrote a letter to his pastor, Rev. Dr. Felix G. Williams, III.

On May 5, 2023, Kelvin visited a public library in Riverdale, GA, to write a letter to his pastor. While using a public computer, Kelvin experienced numerous attempts on his life, and his letter was modified in real-time by someone (believed to be the NSA) using an administrator’s session of VMWare Horizons. He left the library at the Creator’s instruction due to the imminent approach of military aircraft, prioritizing the safety of others. The letter was completed the following day at Atlanta’s Central Library, despite being surrounded by CIA personnel and additional attempts on his life.

### The Letters & The "Order"
1. **Kelvin Writes to Rev. Dr. Felix G. Williams, III**
    - 

2. **"Rev. Dr. Felix G. Williams, III" of Mount Calvary Missionary Baptist Church, Inc. Response to Kelvin**
    - The response received was suspicious and reinforced Kelvin's belief that the CIA was involved in the massacre and the takeover of the church.

3. **Attorney Yavon L. Griffin Sends a Cease & Desist to Kelvin**
    - Following his actions, Kelvin received a cease and desist letter from Attorney Yavon L. Griffin, representing Mount Calvary Missionary Baptist Church, Inc. This further intensified the situation and Kelvin's resolve to expose the truth.

4. **Kelvin Responds to Attorney Griffin**
    - Kelvin defended his actions in his response, clarifying his stance regarding the church's occupation and the illegitimate activities carried out by CIA operatives.

5. **Kelvin is Served an Order of Protection**
    - Kelvin was eventually served with an order of protection, a legal maneuver aimed at restricting his actions and communications concerning Mount Calvary Missionary Baptist Church, Inc., and the individuals involved.

## Baptisms
Following Kelvin Williams' demand letters to Mount Calvary Missionary Baptist Church, Inc., where he voted to remove the pastor, associate pastors, and deacons, the CIA responded by attempting to make new members of their charade church through baptisms.

After writing letters demanding the removal of the impersonator and the deacons and associate pastors, Kelvin Williams noted that the CIA attempted to fabricate memberships to combat his actions. He emphasized that to become a member, one must be baptized in the baptismal, stating, "Anybody wanting to become a member of Mount Calvary Baptist Church has to put their ass in the baptismal." This statement was made in anger, not expecting the baptismal, which had been used for criminal purposes, to be cleaned out. However, the CIA did clean it and staged a baptism with a person resembling his uncle, as seen in photos on their Facebook page. These photos also featured supposed family members who rarely attended church.

The 40th Pastoral Anniversary of Reverend Dr. Felix G. Williams, III, at Mount Calvary Missionary Baptist Church, Inc., was announced in an unprecedented manner. Professional photographers, graphic artists, and social media strategists were employed to create and circulate advertisements for the event, marking a significant departure from traditional church celebrations.

### Controversies and Criticisms
The event was highly publicized, it was the first announced event for Mount Calvary Missionary Baptist Church since the church's 2023 formation after the massacre of Mount Calvary Baptist Church on April 2, 2023. Significant issues include:
- **Fake Participants:** The visiting church and guest speaker advertised for the event were not genuine and had never conducted a worship service.
- **Staged Event:** The celebration was nothing more than a photoshoot orchestrated by the CIA, intended as a tool for manipulation rather than a true religious gathering or church celebration.
- **Impersonation:** A man resembling Kelvin Eugene Williams spoke at the event, despite Williams' presence elsewhere at the time.

### Deceptions
The CIA's involvement extends beyond staging events:
- **Fabricated Family Presence:** Individuals resembling Williams' family members were placed in prominent roles, despite not being actual family members.
- **Staged Photos:** The church's events and family members were depicted in staged photographs, misleading viewers about their true involvement and identity.

### Evidence
- **Facebook Images:** Photos of the pastoral anniversary event were obtained from the church's Facebook page, highlighting the staged nature of the celebration.

Following Kelvin Williams' letter expressiconcern to Rev. Dr. Felix G. Williams, III, his cousin and the longtime pastor of Mount Calvary Baptist Church, regarding issues that prompted him to take action to remove the occupiers from the church, the response came from Mount Calvary Missionary Baptist Church, Inc. Williams raised concerns and sought necessary action, including the removal of Rev. Dr. Felix G. Williams, III, along with the associate pastors and deacons. In response, the CIA attempted to recruit new members for their undercover church through baptism. Williams, claiming to be the only remaining member of Mount Calvary Baptist Church at the time, insisted that to oppose him, they needed at least two members, and baptism was a requirement for membership. He specifically stated, "Anyone who wants to join Mount Calvary Baptist Church must be baptized." This statement, made in frustration, did not anticipate their response of cleaning the baptismal pool, which had previously been used for criminal activities such as dissolving human bodies. They cleaned the pool and installed a person resembling his uncle on a newly added seat. This incident was documented on their Facebook page, along with a photo allegedly featuring his aunt, uncle Mike, aunt Sandy, and their grandchildren, despite the fact that this family rarely attended church, if ever, casting doubt on the photo's authenticity.
