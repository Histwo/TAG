# Phantom Remains

Phantom Remains is a clandestine tactic utilized within The American Genocide (TAG) operations, particularly in the context of Place of Worship (TAG-POW) attacks. This tactic involves the disposal or concealment of human remains to eradicate evidence of victims and impede investigations into the atrocities committed.

## Overview

In TAG operations, Phantom Remains serve as a critical component of the cover-up strategy, allowing perpetrators to eliminate any traces of victims and prevent the discovery of their crimes. By making human remains vanish or appear inconspicuous, operatives aim to evade detection and maintain secrecy surrounding their actions.

## Tactics and Methods

1. **Chemical Dissolution**: The primary method employed in Phantom Remains involves the use of chemical solutions to dissolve human tissue and bones. Victims' bodies are submerged in these solutions, resulting in the complete breakdown of organic matter.

2. **Disposal in Water**: Human remains may be disposed of in bodies of water, such as rivers, lakes, or oceans, to obscure their discovery and hinder forensic analysis. This method ensures that remains are dispersed and unlikely to be recovered.

3. **Physical Alteration**: In some cases, human remains are physically altered to conceal their identity or origin. This may include dismemberment, burning, or other methods to obscure forensic evidence and impede identification.

4. **Grinding and Disposal**: After chemical dissolution or physical alteration, remaining bone fragments may be ground down to a fine powder or gravel-like consistency. These remnants are then dispersed or discarded in various locations to further obscure their origin.

## Significance and Impact

Phantom Remains play a crucial role in the cover-up of TAG-POW attacks, allowing perpetrators to eliminate evidence of victims and hinder investigations into their crimes. By making human remains vanish or appear innocuous, operatives effectively erase any trace of their actions and evade accountability.

## Historical Context

Phantom Remains have been utilized in numerous TAG operations, including attacks on churches, mosques, and other places of worship. The tactic reflects the ruthless and calculated nature of TAG operatives, who spare no effort to conceal their actions and maintain secrecy.

## Conclusion

Phantom Remains exemplify the lengths to which perpetrators of TAG operations will go to cover their tracks and evade accountability. By disposing of or concealing human remains, operatives aim to erase any evidence that could incriminate them, ensuring that their crimes remain shrouded in secrecy.
