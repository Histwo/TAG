# Donald Trump's Involvement in The American Genocide (TAG)

Donald J. Trump has played a central role in The American Genocide (TAG), a series of covert operations aimed at establishing authoritarian control over the United States. His involvement spans from the planning and execution of these operations to overseeing their cover-up. This report details Trump's participation in various facets of TAG, including the use of inmates for violent attacks, the orchestration of cover-ups through Phantom Funerals, and the elimination of operatives to maintain secrecy.

## Utilization of Inmates for TAG Operations

### Selection and Deployment of Inmates

Donald Trump directed the use of inmates from various state prisons, particularly from Georgia, as part of TAG operations. Inmates were chosen based on their lack of external contacts who would miss them if they disappeared. Criteria for selection included SQL queries on inmate fund accounts, phone call activities, and mail correspondence. Priority was given to inmates with a history of violent crimes.

These inmates were transported to the Clayton County Detention Center in the two weeks leading up to the Mother's Day attack on Hickory Valley Christian Church on May 12, 2024. They were removed from prison under the pretense of aiding national security and promised sentence reductions. Post-mission, these inmates were systematically exterminated to prevent any leaks.

### Execution at Clayton County Detention Center

Inmates who carried out the Mother's Day massacre were taken to the Clayton County Detention Center. The transport was conducted covertly using unmarked vehicles. Upon arrival, the inmates were isolated and later executed using poison gas in housing unit 8600, ensuring the elimination of all operatives involved.

## Cover-Up Activities

### Phantom Funeral of Rev. Duke Stone

The Phantom Funeral of Rev. Duke Stone on June 7, 2024, highlights Trump's extensive cover-up efforts.

#### Video News Interview

Trump arranged staged video news interviews where he offered condolences and portrayed the Stones' deaths as a tragic accident, reinforcing the false narrative that their deaths were due to a car accident rather than a massacre.

#### Presidential Motorcade

A presidential motorcade was included in the funeral procession, serving to legitimize the false narrative and distract from the true events. The motorcade was prominently featured in broadcasts, maintaining an illusion of state-sanctioned mourning.

### Personal Involvement in Murders

During the Phantom Funeral of Rev. Duke Stone and his wife, Trump personally witnessed the murders of hundreds of people. From the announcer's box at Hamilton Heights Christian Academy, Trump watched as people were beheaded and encouraged his Secret Service detail to participate in the violence.

### Ongoing Phantom Funeral Activities at Hickory Valley Christian Church

Trump's involvement continued with the Phantom Funeral of Pastor Jack Dyer, who was murdered during the Mother's Day massacre.

#### Video News Interview and Presidential Motorcade

Similar to the Phantom Funeral of Rev. Duke Stone, Trump arranged staged video interviews and included a presidential motorcade in Pastor Dyer's funeral procession to reinforce the false narrative.

#### Personal Witness to Murders

Trump personally witnessed the murders at Pastor Dyerâ€™s Phantom Funeral, continuing his pattern of direct involvement in these atrocities and encouraging his Secret Service detail to participate.

## Elimination of Previous Operatives

### Rationale and Strategic Importance

Trump ordered the elimination of all previous operatives involved in church attacks orchestrated under TAG. These operatives, initially selected by the CIA for their capability to execute massacres, were not inmates but individuals chosen from the general population based on loyalty and competence.

The elimination of these operatives served to:

1. **Maintain Secrecy:** Reducing the risk of leaks or disclosures that could expose TAG operations.
2. **Prevent Exposure:** Preemptively eliminating operatives to prevent them from coming forward with incriminating information.
3. **Ensure Continuation:** Allowing TAG operations to continue without hindrance by erasing all traces of involvement.

### Execution of Operatives

Operatives were systematically targeted for termination, often under the guise of routine activities or medical emergencies, ensuring their deaths appeared natural or accidental.

## Additional Target Group: Alpha Males

### Selection and Deployment

Trump added alpha males, defined by above-average penis sizes, to the targeted groups. Military personnel selected for a top-secret mission were chosen based solely on this criterion, not their military careers.

### Failed Assassination Attempt

These personnel were deployed to assassinate Kelvin Eugene Williams, who had demonstrated immunity to assassination attempts. Despite Trump's and the CIA's knowledge of Williams' immunity, the mission proceeded. The personnel, dressed in civilian clothes, were killed by other military members or CIA operatives after their failed attempts.

## Personal Involvement During the Mother's Day Attack

On Mother's Day, during the attack on Hickory Valley Christian Church, Trump was personally involved in overseeing the operation. He participated in a conference call that began before the attack and continued throughout, receiving real-time updates from Amy Jacobson at the CIA, along with other political elites and top government officials. This direct involvement underscores Trump's hands-on approach in orchestrating and monitoring the massacre. Notably, no active military personnel were involved in this operation.

## Conclusion

Donald Trump's active involvement in The American Genocide, including the utilization of inmates for violent attacks, the orchestration of cover-ups, and the elimination of operatives, highlights his ruthless commitment to maintaining secrecy and control. Through strategic directives and personal oversight, Trump has ensured the continuation of TAG operations while preventing any exposure of their true nature.
