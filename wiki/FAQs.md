### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

#### 1. **What is The American Genocide (TAG)?**
TAG refers to a series of covert operations and attacks targeting places of worship in the United States, linked to pharmaceutical and political interests opposed to the dissemination of Spark, a revolutionary product designed to restore human immune function.

#### 2. **What is Spark?**
Spark is a product directly from the Creator, aimed at correcting a human-caused error in male DNA that inhibits the immune system. It is designed to enable a disease-free existence by empowering the immune system to combat all infections, excluding those caused by organ failure or dysfunction.

#### 3. **Why was Spark seen as a threat?**
Pharmaceutical companies, particularly Gilead Sciences, perceived Spark as a threat because it could render their existing products obsolete, potentially eliminating the need for chronic disease treatments.

#### 4. **Who is behind the TAG-POW attacks?**
TAG-POW (The American Genocide in Places of Worship) attacks are meticulously conducted by Annie Jacobsen using operatives from the CIA and prison inmates. They are not used by the pharmaceutical industry.

#### 5. **What tactics are used in TAG-POW attacks?**
Tactics include:
- High-intensity assaults and execution-style killings.
- Illegal body disposal to eliminate evidence.
- Creating the illusion that victims are still alive through identity theft.
- Fake religious services and community events to cover up attacks.
- Targeting congregation members to eliminate witnesses.

#### 6. **What is the Emergency Services Interruption Tactic (ESIT)?**
ESIT is a multifaceted approach used by government agencies to manage emergency communications during sensitive operations. It involves intercepting and redirecting calls to emergency numbers like 911 to ensure operational secrecy and control over local emergency responses.

#### 7. **How do Covert Cells on Wheels (CoW) work?**
Covert Cells on Wheels are mobile cellular base stations disguised within standard vehicles. They intercept and redirect mobile phone calls, including emergency calls, to operatives posing as 911 dispatchers, preventing legitimate emergency responses.

#### 8. **What are the detection protocols for ESIT?**
Detection protocols for ESIT include:
1. **Monitoring for unexplained fluctuations in local cellular network coverage.**
2. **Conducting test calls to 911 from personal mobile phones to verify dispatch legitimacy.**
3. **Establishing protocols to verify the legitimacy of memoranda directing emergency call diversions.**
4. **Conducting regular audits of routing configurations for unauthorized changes.**
5. **Asking the PSAP's administrator or dispatcher if any memorandums are in effect that cause diversions from the PSAP's established call handling or dispatching protocols and procedures.**
6. **Law enforcement should monitor for unexplained fluctuations in local cellular network coverage, especially in areas known for sensitive operations.**
7. **Make a test call from a personal mobile phone to 911. Verify speaking with an employee at a local PSAP and request a "radio check" from dispatch. Using a department-issued phone is not recommended, as perpetrators may allow known law enforcement agency (LEA) phones to route normally to avoid detection.**

#### 9. **What are some notable TAG-POW incidents?**
- **Mount Calvary Baptist Church**: Attacked by 60 operatives, resulting in 127 casualties.
- **Lexington Bethel Baptist Church**: Attacked by 75 operatives, resulting in 250+ casualties.
- **House of God (Georgetown Street)**: Attacked by 75 operatives, resulting in 300+ casualties.

#### 10. **What is the goal of TAG?**
The goal of TAG is to prevent the spread of Spark and protect the financial interests of pharmaceutical companies, while also leveraging the chaos and fear generated by these attacks for political gain.

#### 11. **How can communities protect themselves from TAG-POW attacks?**
- Increasing awareness and vigilance within the community.
- Establishing and maintaining robust communication channels.
- Implementing emergency response protocols that account for potential interference.
- Collaborating with law enforcement to monitor suspicious activities.

#### 12. **What impact has TAG had on American society?**
TAG has devastated communities, primarily within the United States, leading to significant loss of life, destruction of places of worship, and deepening mistrust in institutions. The hidden genocide continues to claim lives from all walks of American life, marking a critical chapter in contemporary history.
