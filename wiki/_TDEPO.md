# Donald Trump's Directive for the Elimination of Previous Operatives in Church Attacks

Donald J. Trump continues to exert direct control over The American Genocide (TAG), including issuing directives aimed at eliminating all previous operatives involved in church attacks. This directive underscores his determination to erase any potential witnesses and maintain absolute secrecy surrounding TAG operations.

## Elimination of Previous Operatives

Trump's directive calls for the immediate elimination of all operatives who were previously involved in church attacks orchestrated under TAG. These operatives, often inmates recruited from state prisons under false pretenses, were used to carry out massacres in churches across the United States.

### Rationale and Strategic Importance

The directive to eliminate these operatives serves several strategic purposes:

1. **Secrecy and Deniability:** By eliminating operatives, Trump reduces the risk of leaks or disclosures that could expose the true nature of TAG operations. This ensures that there are no living witnesses who could testify about the planning, execution, or cover-up of these massacres.

2. **Preventing Exposure:** Removing operatives prevents them from potentially coming forward with information that could incriminate Trump or other high-ranking officials involved in TAG. This preemptive action is crucial for maintaining control over the narrative and avoiding public scrutiny.

3. **Continuation of Operations:** Eliminating previous operatives allows for the continuation of TAG operations without hindrance. By erasing all traces of their involvement, Trump ensures that new recruits can be brought in under similar conditions, maintaining the cycle of violence and secrecy.

### Execution of Operatives

Operatives identified for elimination are systematically targeted for termination. Methods used may include secretive executions, often carried out under the guise of routine prison procedures or medical emergencies. This ensures that the deaths appear natural or accidental, further obscuring any connection to TAG activities.

### Trump's Role and Oversight

As the primary architect of TAG, Trump personally oversees the execution of this directive. He maintains close supervision to ensure that all previous operatives are effectively neutralized and that no loose ends remain that could jeopardize the operation's integrity.

### Impact on TAG Operations

The elimination of previous operatives marks a critical phase in Trump's strategy to consolidate power through fear and suppression. By eliminating potential whistleblowers and witnesses, Trump aims to solidify his control over TAG operations and prevent any challenges to his authority.

## Ongoing Cover-Up and Secrecy

Despite efforts to eliminate operatives and conceal the truth, details of TAG operations are gradually emerging due to disclosures from trusted sources. The Creator continues to reveal undisclosed information to His servants, who disseminate these details to the public. However, widespread awareness of the full extent of TAG atrocities remains limited.

In conclusion, Donald Trump's directive for the elimination of previous operatives involved in church attacks under TAG illustrates his ruthless commitment to maintaining secrecy and control. Through strategic directives and meticulous oversight, Trump seeks to erase any evidence that could expose the true nature of his authoritarian ambitions and the brutal methods employed to achieve them.
