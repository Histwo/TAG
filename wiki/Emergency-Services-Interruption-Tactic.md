### Tactic Description: Disabling Access to 911 / Cellular Communication Interception and Local Dispatch Procedures Diversion during Covert Operations

#### Overview

The CIA and FBI utilized a dual-faceted approach to intercept communications to emergency numbers (eg. 911) and prevent a local emergency response during a covert operation in the targeted area. This involved sophisticated interception of mobile and landline communications and diversion from the Public Safety Answering Point’s (PSAP) established call handling and dispatching procedures, ensuring complete operational secrecy and manipulation of emergency responses.

#### Components

1. **Cellular Communication Interception**

   - **Description**: A Cell on Wheels disguised as a regular passenger vehicle, equipped to intercept mobile phone signals within a specified target area.
   - **Function**: 
     - Caused all mobile phones in the target area to connect to the CoW which has no connection or backhaul to a legitimate Mobile Network Operator/Service Provider. 
     - Configured to redirect calls to emergency numbers, especially those to 911, to a team of CIA operatives posing as 911 dispatchers. 
     - The CIA operatives take information and assure callers  first responders are en-route. No dispatch is performed, sole purpose is to prevent individuals under assault from forming an organized resistance. 
     - Access to other dialed numbers and the Internet are blocked. 

2. **Memorandum for Local Dispatch Procedures Diversion**

   - **Description**: A directive issued by the FBI to the Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP).
   - **Function**:
     - Instructs the PSAP to refer any emergency requests from the targeted area to the FBI for coordination and dispatch. 
     - The FBI, upon receiving the requests, will acknowledge them but will take no further action, effectively blocking local emergency intervention.

#### Execution

- **Timing**: The CoW is activated just before the arrival of operatives to the target site, ensuring immediate interception of mobile communications as the operation commenced. The memorandum's (already received by the PSAP) takes effect (starts) and stops upon receiving notification from the FBI (voice call).
- **Operational Area**: The CoW covers a minimum 0.5-mile radius around CoW's location, ensuring all mobile signals were intercepted and rerouted.
- **Coordination**: The Memorandum for Local Dispatch Procedures Diversion ensured that any requests from the target’s landline received by the PSAP were sent to the FBI for handling.

#### Impact

- **Manipulation**: They effectively manipulated emergency responses, preventing local authorities from intervening in the covert operation.
- **Secrecy**: Ensured the secrecy and success of the operation by controlling and stifling emergency communication channels.

#### Outcome

These coordinated tactics allowed the CIA and FBI to execute their covert operation in the targeted area without local emergency services interference, maintaining the element of surprise and operational secrecy essential for their mission.
