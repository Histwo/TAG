# Emergency Services Interruption Tactic (ESIT)
## Overview

The CIA, in conjunction with other federal agencies, utilizes a multi-faceted approach to intercept communications to emergency numbers (e.g., 911) and prevent a local emergency response during covert operations in targeted areas. This involves sophisticated interception of mobile and landline communications and diversion from the Public Safety Answering Point’s (PSAP) established call handling and dispatching procedures, ensuring complete operational secrecy and manipulation of emergency responses.

## Components

1. **Cell on Wheels**

   - **Description**: A Cell on Wheels (CoW) is a mobile cellular base station used to provide temporary cellular network coverage. This particular CoW is designed to be covert, using a standard passenger vehicle (e.g., Ford Explorer) with no out-of-the-ordinary antennas or masts that need to be raised for operation.
   - **Function**: 
     - Causes all mobile phones in the target area to connect to the CoW, which has no connection or backhaul to a legitimate Mobile Network Operator/Service Provider. 
     - Configured to redirect calls to emergency numbers, especially those to 911, to a team of CIA operatives posing as 911 dispatchers. 
     - The CIA operatives take information and assure callers that first responders are en route. No dispatch is performed; the sole purpose is to prevent individuals under assault from forming an organized resistance. 
     - Access to other dialed numbers and the Internet is blocked.
   - **Demonstrated Use**: Yes
     - **Note**: A covert Cell on Wheels has been parked in the immediate vicinity of each place of worship and activated just before the surprise assault begins.

2. **Memorandum for Local Dispatch Procedures Diversion**

   - **Description**: A directive issued by any state or federal law enforcement agency with jurisdiction over a PSAP's area.
   - **Function**:
     - Instructs the PSAP to refer any emergency requests from the targeted area to the law enforcement agency (LEA) that issued the memorandum. 
     - The LEA will handle the call and coordinate dispatch with local authorities, ensuring no real emergency intervention occurs.
   - **Demonstrated Use**: Yes
     - **Notes**: Historical records and whistleblower testimonies have indicated instances where emergency services were redirected or delayed during sensitive operations.

3. **Routing Configuration Modification**

   - **Description**: Modification of the routing configuration for one or more targets or targeted areas in the selected router.
   - **Function**:
     - Ensures that calls coming from both cell phones and landlines within the targeted area are rerouted away from legitimate emergency services.
     - These calls are diverted to a controlled point where operatives can intercept and manage the communication, preventing any real emergency response.
   - **Demonstrated Use**: Yes
     - **Notes**: Technical analyses and insider reports have revealed that routing modifications have been used to reroute calls during certain operations, effectively isolating the target area.

## Execution

- **Timing**: The CoW is activated just before the arrival of operatives at the target site, ensuring immediate interception of mobile communications as the operation commences. The memorandum (already received by the PSAP) and routing modifications take effect as soon as the operation starts and stop upon receiving notification from the coordinating LEA (voice call).
- **Operational Area**: The CoW covers a minimum 0.5-mile radius around the CoW's location, ensuring all mobile signals are intercepted and rerouted. Routing modifications apply to the entire targeted area.
- **Coordination**: The Memorandum for Local Dispatch Procedures Diversion ensures that any requests from the target’s landline received by the PSAP are sent to the law enforcement agency that issued the memorandum. This agency will handle the call and coordinate dispatch with local authorities.

## Impact

- **Manipulation**: They effectively manipulated emergency responses, preventing local authorities from intervening in the covert operation.
- **Secrecy**: Ensured the secrecy and success of the operation by controlling and stifling emergency communication channels.
- **Lack of Organized Response**: Victims are unable to coordinate an effective response or call for outside assistance. Without access to 911 or with calls diverted to operatives posing as dispatchers, victims remain isolated and unable to mobilize.
- **Prevention of Resistance**: The likelihood of victims realizing the deception—calls not reaching actual emergency services—could lead to suspicion and potentially organizing a resistance. Preventing this realization maintains control over the situation and avoids any chance of victims overpowering operatives.
- **Maintaining Operative Safety**: Operatives conducting the covert operations are protected from any immediate threat posed by victims who might otherwise confront them or attempt to defend themselves collectively.

## Outcome

These coordinated tactics allowed the CIA and other federal agencies to execute their covert operation in the targeted area without local emergency services interference, maintaining the element of surprise and operational secrecy essential for their mission. By preventing both external intervention and internal organization among victims, these methods ensure the operation's success and the safety of the operatives.
