**The Creator says that TAG is a genocide.** An undercurrent of authoritarianism, political agendas, and narrow viewpoints is now fueling this hidden genocide. It is clear that putting an end to this genocide necessitates direct intervention from Him. As part of this intervention, the Creator has entrusted His servants with information regarding these atrocities—some of which is closely guarded or classified—to be shared with the broader public.

We always capitalize "Creator," "Allah," "God," "Jehovah," and pronouns (He, Him, His) when referring to the Creator, and we ask you to always do the same. When we capitalize "We," "Us," and "Our" mid-sentence, we are saying “Creator and His two servants.”
