# The American Genocide - Places of Worship 
These massacres are each part of a series of coordinated attacks on places of worship (POWs) during The American Genocide (TAG), known as TAG-POW attacks. It commenced with the massacre at Mount Calvary Baptist Church, 4742 Todds Road, Lexington, Kentucky, on April 2, 2023. Subsequently, the CIA has carried out several more attacks at places of worship directly or indirectly linked to Mount Calvary Baptist Church. These incidents have predominantly transpired in Kentucky.

The targeted places of worship include:
- Mount Calvary Baptist Church, Lexington, Kentucky
- Lexington Bethel Baptist Church, Lexington, Kentucky
- Mount Zion Baptist Church, Versailles, Kentucky
- House of God (Georgetown St), Lexington, Kentucky
- House of God (Broadway), Lexington, Kentucky
- Hickory Valley Christian Church, Chattanooga, Tennessee

## Tactics
### "Surprise, Kill, Vanish"
Each attack on a place of worship has displayed tactics described in Annie Jacobsen's book "Surprise, Kill, Vanish." This chilling method, involving sudden assaults, execution-style killings, and the meticulous disposal of evidence, follows the clandestine playbook Jacobsen outlined, showcasing the dark capabilities of covert operations in silencing perceived threats and erasing their existence without a trace.

## Motivation 
Some apparent motives behind all the attacks are to eliminate individuals who have knowledge of Kelvin Eugene Williams or his family, especially Patricia Ann Crawley-Rogers Williams. The CIA and federal government aim to ensure Kelvin Eugene Williams cannot reveal their atrocities at Sandy Hook (Maury County), TN, or his lifelong church. Based on CIA behavior, any congregation that knew Mount Calvary Baptist Church (Lexington, KY) or had heard of the massacre must also be eliminated. Additionally, any group or individual who poses a threat of discovering, discussing, or publicizing these church massacres is targeted for elimination.

These attacks have been closely monitored by the federal government and political elite, who have been aware of planned actions by the CIA and have received briefings during the attacks. The Creator says their involvement is due to their undisclosed desires to move towards an authoritarian government. These motives highlight the ruthless nature of the perpetrators, who are willing to engage in heinous acts to sever any ties to their crimes.
