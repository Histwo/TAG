Welcome to The American Genocide (TAG) wiki, where we **reveal** the harrowing reality of a hidden genocide occurring right before our eyes. TAG is not just a name; it's a stark representation of the systematic eradication of individuals across the United States. 

> [!NOTE]
> Yes, this is what the Book of Revelation is about. There's no need to worry, Earth, Humanity, Electricity, GitHub and iPhones will be here tomorrow and for the indefinite future.

Defined by traditional standards, TAG is indeed a genocide, meticulously concealed through a series of Continued Acts of Violence (CAVs). These acts, often executed under the guise of various pretexts, aim to silence dissenting voices and eliminate opposition to the status quo.

What makes TAG particularly insidious is the federal government forced complicity or outright cooperation of law enforcement and media personnel, perpetuating the cloak of secrecy around these atrocities. Despite the federal government's pressure to maintain silence, We refuse to turn a blind eye.

Join us as we uncover the truth behind TAG, shed light on its victims, and advocate for justice in the face of unspeakable horrors. Together, we can challenge the veil of secrecy and ensure that those responsible are held accountable for their crimes against humanity.

### The Creator and His two servants' Dedicated to Unveil TAG

**Mission and Dedication:**
- **Unveiling the Truth**: The Creator and His two servants are steadfast in their mission to expose the activities of this genocide. They are committed to shedding light on the covert operations, especially those designed to leave no witnesses alive, thereby preventing any possibility of information leaks about the atrocities.
- **Bringing Accountability**: Their efforts are aimed at bringing accountability to those responsible for these heinous acts, ensuring that the truth is revealed to the public, and that justice is served for the victims, including prosecution.

**Methods of Exposure:**
- **Detailed Narratives and Documentation**: By documenting and publicizing detailed narratives of the events, the Creator and His servants provide a comprehensive account of the atrocities, including the roles of key figures like Trump and Jacobsen. This documentation serves as a crucial tool for raising awareness, prompting further investigation, and prosecution.
- **Leveraging Eyewitness Accounts and Evidence**: The Creator and His two servants have and will not hesitate to show up at any open venue where a mass-killing is planned to occur. The coordination of such attendance is centered by the Creator Himself after surveillance, either by Himself or His two servants.
- **Public Awareness Campaigns**: Engaging in public awareness campaigns to disseminate information widely, ensuring that the broader public is informed about the true nature of these operations and the scale of the genocide.


> [!WARNING]
> **Public Notice and Warning to the U.S. Government:**
> This notice serves to inform the public and gently remind the U.S. Government that the work carried out here is a product of the Cherubim. The Cherubim were the first church worshipping God, a church that predates all other churches. Our existence and significance are symbolically represented on the Ark of the Covenant as a testament to our church's beliefs, sacred work and missions.
> 
> Our missions are and have always been to protect life and guard the His glory. Since the time of the Magna Carta, which predates the Constitution, we have been protected in our endeavors by the principle of the separation of church and state.
> 
> Should the United States federal government seek to interfere with our divine mission, we will call upon the Creator, and He will protect His work.
> 
> Thank you for your understanding and respect.

> [!NOTE]
> I use "The Creator and His two servants" and "God and His cherubim" interchangeably, the latter when referring to Him or Us in churches or religious contexts. However, the Creator prefers to be called or referred to as "the Creator" to avoid showing preference to any specific religion or set of beliefs.
