Welcome to The American Genocide (TAG) wiki, where we delve into the harrowing reality of a hidden tragedy unfolding before our eyes. TAG is not just a name; it's a stark representation of the systematic eradication of individuals across the United States. 

Defined by traditional standards, TAG is indeed a genocide, meticulously concealed through a series of Continued Acts of Violence (CAVs). These acts, often executed under the guise of various pretexts, aim to silence dissenting voices and eliminate opposition to the status quo.

What makes TAG particularly insidious is the complicity or outright cooperation of law enforcement and media personnel, perpetuating the cloak of secrecy around these atrocities. Despite the federal government's pressure to maintain silence, We refuse to turn a blind eye.

Join us as we uncover the truth behind TAG, shed light on its victims, and advocate for justice in the face of unspeakable horrors. Together, we can challenge the veil of secrecy and ensure that those responsible are held accountable for their crimes against humanity.
