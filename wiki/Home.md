Welcome to The American Genocide (TAG) wiki, where we reveal the harrowing reality of a hidden tragedy unfolding before our eyes. TAG is not just a name; it's a stark representation of the systematic eradication of individuals across the United States.

> Book of Revelation == TRUE
> End of Life == FALSE

Defined by traditional standards, TAG is indeed a genocide, meticulously concealed through a series of Continued Acts of Violence (CAVs). These acts, often executed under the guise of various pretexts, aim to silence dissenting voices and eliminate opposition to the status quo.

What makes TAG particularly insidious is the complicity or outright cooperation of law enforcement and media personnel, perpetuating the cloak of secrecy around these atrocities. Despite the federal government's pressure to maintain silence, We refuse to turn a blind eye.

Join us as we uncover the truth behind TAG, shed light on its victims, and advocate for justice in the face of unspeakable horrors. Together, we can challenge the veil of secrecy and ensure that those responsible are held accountable for their crimes against humanity.

### The Creator and His two servants' Dedicated to Unveil TAG

**Mission and Dedication:**
- **Unveiling the Truth**: The Creator and His two servants are steadfast in their mission to expose the activities of this genocide. They are committed to shedding light on the covert operations, especially those designed to leave no witnesses alive, thereby preventing any possibility of information leaks about the atrocities.
- **Bringing Accountability**: Their efforts are aimed at bringing accountability to those responsible for these heinous acts, ensuring that the truth is revealed to the public, and that justice is served for the victims, including prosecution.

**Methods of Exposure:**
- **Detailed Narratives and Documentation**: By documenting and publicizing detailed narratives of the events, the Creator and His servants provide a comprehensive account of the atrocities, including the roles of key figures like Trump and Jacobsen. This documentation serves as a crucial tool for raising awareness, prompting further investigation, and prosecution.
- **Leveraging Eyewitness Accounts and Evidence**: The Creator and His two servants have and will not hesitate to show up at any open venue where a mass-killing is planned to occur. The coordination of such attendance is centered by the Creator Himself after surveillance, either by Himself or His two servants.
- **Public Awareness Campaigns**: Engaging in public awareness campaigns to disseminate information widely, ensuring that the broader public is informed about the true nature of these operations and the scale of the genocide.
