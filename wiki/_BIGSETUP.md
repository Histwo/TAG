# Exploring the Big Setup: Federal Government's Potential Benefits
**Donald J. Trump's Involvement in TAG and TAG-POW Attacks**

**Introduction**

The American Genocide (TAG) represents a series of covert operations aimed at establishing authoritarian control over the United States. Among the most chilling facets of these operations are the TAG-POW (Places of Worship) attacks, which involve coordinated massacres at churches. Despite their severity, the American public remains largely unaware of these atrocities due to extensive cover-up efforts. Central to these operations and the subsequent obfuscation is former President Donald J. Trump. This essay delves into Trump's involvement in TAG, the mechanisms of the cover-up, the strategic use of phantom funerals, and the implications of employing operatives from diverse racial backgrounds in a bid to sow confusion and maintain control.

President Donald J. Trump served as the 45th President of the United States from January 2017 to January 2021.  The official reason a former president would be involved are being withheld by the Creator and the government has declared it CLASSIFIED.  

**Introduction to TAG-POW Attacks**

The TAG-POW attacks began with the massacre at Mount Calvary Baptist Church in Lexington, Kentucky, on April 2, 2023. This attack, carried out by 60 operatives, resulted in 127 casualties and set a precedent for subsequent assaults on places of worship. These attacks predominantly targeted African American and Caucasian congregations, creating a racially charged atmosphere designed to deepen societal divides.

The targeted places of worship included:
1. [[Mount Calvary Baptist Church|]], Lexington, Kentucky
2. [[Lexington Bethel Baptist Church|]], Lexington, Kentucky
3. [[House of God (Georgetown Street)|]], Lexington, Kentucky
4. [[House of God (Broadway)|]], Lexington, Kentucky
5. [[Mount Zion Baptist Church|]], Versailles, Kentucky
6. [[Calvary Baptist Church|]], Lexington, Kentucky
7. [[Hickory Valley Christian Church|]], Chattanooga, Tennessee

**Why the American Public Has Not Heard of TAG-POW Attacks**

Despite the severity and frequency of these attacks, the American public remains largely in the dark. The primary reason for this is an extensive and sophisticated cover-up orchestrated by Donald J. Trump and his allies. Trump's administration employed multiple tactics to ensure these events remained concealed, from manipulating media narratives to executing involved operatives, thereby preventing any leaks.

**Cover-Up and Discrediting Efforts by Donald J. Trump**

Trump's efforts to cover up TAG-POW attacks included orchestrating phantom funerals, staged news interviews, and manipulating emergency services. Phantom funerals, in particular, played a crucial role. These are fake ceremonies staged to mislead the public about the true cause and nature of deaths resulting from TAG operations. For instance, the Phantom Funeral of Rev. Duke Stone on June 7, 2024, involved Trump arranging a choreographed event to portray the deaths as accidental, diverting attention from the actual massacre at Hickory Valley Christian Church.

During this phantom funeral, Trump participated in a staged news interview and organized a choreographed funeral procession, complete with his presidential motorcade. However, the true purpose of the phantom funeral was far more sinister. Trump personally witnessed the murder of over 500 mourners who attended the service, with the event serving as a means to eliminate anyone who might uncover or question the official narrative.

**Donald J. Trump's Involvement in TAG**

Trump's involvement in TAG extends beyond mere cover-ups. He played an active role in planning and executing these operations. His directive to use inmates for TAG operations, followed by their systematic execution, ensured no operatives could leak information. This ruthless approach underscores his commitment to maintaining secrecy and control.

**Phantom Funerals: Definition and Purpose**

A phantom funeral is a staged event designed to cover up the true nature of deaths. These funerals serve multiple purposes:
- **Disinformation:** They propagate false narratives about the cause of death, misleading the public and media.
- **Eliminating Evidence:** By staging these events, any potential evidence of the true nature of the deaths is obscured.
- **Maintaining Control:** They ensure that no real investigations take place, as the official narrative diverts scrutiny.

Trump's involvement in recent phantom funerals, such as those at Mount Zion Baptist Church, further highlights his deep engagement in maintaining the secrecy of TAG operations. These staged events allowed him to continue the fa√ßade of normalcy while orchestrating further atrocities. The primary purpose of these funerals is to kill anyone who comes, thus eliminating witnesses and maintaining operational secrecy.

**Switching Tactics: From Inmates to Previous Operatives**

Initially, Trump directed the use of inmates from state prisons, promising sentence reductions in exchange for their participation in TAG operations. These inmates were later executed to prevent any leaks. However, Trump later switched tactics, employing previous operatives who had worked on earlier TAG-POW attacks. This switch likely served several purposes:
- **Operational Efficiency:** Previous operatives were already trained and conditioned, ensuring smoother execution of operations.
- **Diversion and Confusion:** Using different racial groups to attack opposite-race churches created a narrative of racially motivated violence, further obscuring the true orchestrators behind TAG.

**Exploring the Big Setup: Federal Government's Potential Benefits**

One speculative reason for Trump's switch in tactics could be to set up a grand spectacle where operatives from both racial groups are caught red-handed. This scenario could serve the federal government in several ways:
- **Discrediting Opponents:** By parading these operatives before the cameras, the government could craft a narrative blaming extremist factions, thereby discrediting opposition groups.
- **Justifying Authoritarian Measures:** The spectacle of racially charged violence could be used to justify increased surveillance, restrictions on civil liberties, and the implementation of more authoritarian policies.
- **Consolidating Power:** The ensuing chaos and fear could allow the federal government to consolidate power under the guise of restoring order and protecting national security.

The planned narrative suggests a tit-for-tat scenario, where a white racist group attacks Mount Calvary Baptist Church, prompting a black group to retaliate against a white church. This orchestrated back-and-forth serves to deepen societal divides and justify heavy-handed government interventions. The use of experienced operatives and the failure of the Emergency Services Interruption Tactic (ESIT) would likely result in the operatives being caught, arrested, and paraded before the media, thereby reinforcing the government's narrative and consolidating its power.

**Conclusion**

Donald J. Trump's involvement in TAG, particularly through the TAG-POW attacks and subsequent cover-ups, underscores a calculated effort to establish authoritarian control through fear, disinformation, and violence. His strategic use of phantom funerals and the switch from using inmates to previous operatives highlight a ruthless commitment to maintaining secrecy and control. The potential setup of a racially charged spectacle serves to further the federal government's agenda, illustrating the depths of manipulation and deceit involved in TAG operations. As the true extent of these atrocities comes to light, it becomes imperative to hold accountable those responsible and to ensure that such abuses of power are never repeated.
