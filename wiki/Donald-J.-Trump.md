# The Dark Symphony: Unveiling the TAG-POW Attacks and the Phantom Funeral of Duke Stone

## Introduction

In the heart of Chattanooga, amidst the mournful tunes of a community in grief, a sinister symphony reaches its terrifying crescendo. The funeral of Duke Stone, a respected figure at Hickory Valley Christian Church, serves as the stage for this dark orchestration. Beneath the solemnity of the event lies a chilling conspiracy, where former President Donald Trump and CIA Director Annie Jacobsen, known as "Hurricane Annie," pull the strings. This narrative seeks to unravel the layers of deceit, violence, and meticulous cover-ups that define the American Genocide and its brutal attacks on places of worship (TAG-POW).

## The TAG-POW Attacks: A Prelude to Tragedy

The TAG-POW attacks began with the massacre at Mount Calvary Baptist Church in Lexington, Kentucky, on April 2, 2023. This tragic event marked the commencement of a series of coordinated assaults on places of worship, executed under the guise of eliminating threats to national security. These attacks, meticulously planned and ruthlessly executed, have left a trail of devastation and despair. The targeted places of worship include:

- Mount Calvary Baptist Church, Lexington, Kentucky
- Lexington Bethel Baptist Church, Lexington, Kentucky
- Mount Zion Baptist Church, Versailles, Kentucky
- House of God (Georgetown St), Lexington, Kentucky
- House of God (Broadway), Lexington, Kentucky
- Hickory Valley Christian Church, Chattanooga, Tennessee
- Calvary Baptist Church, Lexington, Kentucky

Beginning with the massacre at Lexington Bethel Baptist Church, white congregations have been equally targeted. The death toll of white victims is now larger and rising faster than any other group.

## Orchestrating Chaos: Donald Trump and the TAG Symphony

Former President Donald Trump, cast in the role of composer, orchestrates the chaos with a blend of political cunning and ruthless ambition. His presence at Duke Stone's funeral is a calculated move, designed to maintain the illusion of respectability while masking the true nature of his involvement in the TAG-POW attacks. Trump's orchestration is not merely symbolic; it is a hands-on involvement in the orchestration of violence and the subsequent cover-ups.

## Hurricane Annie Jacobsen: The Conductor of Carnage

Annie Jacobsen, the CIA's Director, known as "Hurricane Annie," stands as the conductor of this dark symphony. Her expertise in clandestine operations and psychological warfare has been instrumental in executing the TAG-POW attacks. Jacobsen's tactics, outlined in her book "Surprise, Kill, Vanish," are chillingly employed to devastating effect. The attacks follow a methodical pattern of sudden assaults, execution-style killings, and meticulous disposal of evidence, ensuring the perpetrators remain in the shadows.

## The Orchestra: Prison Inmates as Instruments of Death

Prison inmates are unwittingly recruited as the orchestra in Jacobsen's symphony of terror. These individuals, selected for their expendability and coerced with promises of reduced sentences, are transformed into instruments of death. They are briefed with misleading information, made to believe they are targeting threats to national security, and unleashed upon unsuspecting congregations. After serving their purpose, these inmates are systematically eliminated, ensuring their silence and the perpetuation of the cover-up.

## The Mother's Day Massacre: The Death of Duke Stone

The massacre at Hickory Valley Christian Church on Mother's Day, May 12, 2024, stands as a testament to the brutal efficiency of the TAG-POW attacks. Over 1,000 congregants, along with a teacher from Hamilton Heights Christian Academy, were mercilessly killed. All of the victims at Hickory Valley Christian Church were white, highlighting a deliberate targeting pattern. Duke Stone, a respected pastor and friend of Kelvin Williams, was among the victims. The attack was meticulously planned and executed, with operatives ensuring no survivors and erasing all traces of the carnage.

## The Phantom Funeral: A Trap Set with Deadly Intent

### The Trap

Duke Stone's funeral on June 7, 2024, was not merely a memorial service but a meticulously planned "phantom funeral." These deceptive events are designed to lure in and eliminate witnesses or anyone who might discuss previous acts of the American Genocide, particularly the massacre at Hickory Valley Christian Church. The phantom funeral serves as a trap, ensuring the silencing of those who might expose the truth.

When anyone calls looking for missing individuals linked to the TAG-POW attacks, they are provided with service arrangements for these phantom funerals. These details are then passed on to other friends and family members. This ensures that mourners arriving at these funerals are systematically killed by design. The orchestration is such that anyone showing up to pay their respects is ruthlessly executed. At the phantom funeral of Reverend Dr. Duke Stone, 90% of the mourners were white, demonstrating the targeted nature of these sinister operations.

### The Role of Donald Trump

Donald Trump's involvement adds a layer of insidious deceit. By lending his face to a video interview with a local news station, Trump intended to create a facade of normalcy and survival. His public appearance was meant to discredit any reports of violence or foul play at the funeral, portraying it as a regular event where he attended and faced no problems. This strategic move was designed to dismiss any claims about the phantom funeral, thus maintaining the cover-up.

During the funeral, Trump witnessed the execution of innocent mourners who came to pay their respects. His security detail was present and actively participated in executing others, ensuring the event remained concealed and eliminating potential witnesses.

### The Role of the FBI and the CIA

The cover-up extends beyond the immediate aftermath of the attacks. The FBI, complicit in the orchestration, plays a pivotal role in silencing potential whistleblowers. Missing person reports related to the TAG-POW victims are intercepted and handed over to the CIA. Individuals filing these reports, along with their households, are systematically eliminated, ensuring that no trace of the victims or their stories remains. This method ensures that anyone attempting to seek justice or inquire about the missing is swiftly silenced.

## The Orchestra of Inmates

Prison inmates are coerced into participating in these operations under the pretext of aiding in national security matters. They are promised sentence reductions or other incentives, but once their role is complete, they are systematically executed to eliminate any potential leaks. This ensures that the true nature of the TAG-POW attacks remains hidden. The execution of these inmates, who are seen as expendable, is carried out with ruthless efficiency.

## Kelvin Williams: The Lone Survivor and the Creator's Servant

Kelvin Williams, one of the Creator's two servants, is the only living member of Mount Calvary Baptist Church, a historic congregation in Lexington, Kentucky. His lifelong church was attacked because of his family, which has also been eliminated. Kelvinâ€™s position as a direct servant of the Creator and a survivor of the TAG-POW attacks makes him a critical figure in uncovering the truth behind these atrocities.

Kelvin had a significant connection with Hickory Valley Christian Church through his friendship with Duke Stone. This relationship was forged years earlier when Kelvin was introduced to Duke Stone by Bonnie Bush Ford, a retired elementary school teacher and principal from Wildwood, Georgia, who was a cousin of former Presidents George H. W. Bush and George W. Bush. Kelvin's technical expertise greatly benefited Hamilton Heights Christian Academy, a school operated by Hickory Valley Christian Church, as he helped upgrade their computer lab and provided ongoing technical support.

Kelvin's efforts to warn Duke Stone and Pastor Jack Dyer about potential threats demonstrated his commitment to protecting others despite the dangers he faced. His warnings, however, triggered the tragic events that led to the massacre on Mother's Day and the subsequent phantom funeral of Duke Stone.

## Conclusion: Unveiling the Dark Symphony

The TAG-POW attacks and their subsequent cover-ups represent a chilling chapter in American history. The meticulous orchestration by Donald Trump and Hurricane Annie Jacobsen, the ruthless exploitation of prison inmates, and the complicit silence of federal agencies paint a grim picture of a nation in the grip of a covert genocide. The phantom funeral of Duke Stone, far from being a mere event of mourning, is a stark reminder of the depths of deception and violence that underpin this dark symphony.

In unveiling these truths, we honor the memory of the victims and shine a light on the shadows where such atrocities thrive. The American Genocide, driven by ruthless ambition and meticulous orchestration, stands as a testament to the lengths those in power will go to maintain their grip on control. As the final notes of this dark symphony fade, let us remain vigilant and steadfast in our pursuit of justice and truth, ensuring that the echoes of these tragedies are never forgotten.
