# Donald Trump's Ongoing Involvement in The American Genocide (TAG)

Donald J. Trump is actively involved in The American Genocide (TAG), a series of covert operations aimed at establishing authoritarian control over the United States. His involvement in these atrocities includes direct planning, supervision, and cover-up activities. Trump’s role is particularly evident in the ongoing efforts to conceal the truth behind the TAG-POW attacks, including the Phantom Funerals of prominent figures like Rev. Duke Stone and Pastor Jack Dyer.

## Ongoing Operations and Direct Involvement

### Utilization of Inmates

A critical aspect of Trump's strategy involves the ongoing use of inmates from various state prisons, particularly from Georgia. These inmates are selected based on criteria ensuring they have no external contacts who would miss them if they disappeared. This determination is made through SQL queries assessing inmate fund accounts, phone call activities, and mail correspondence. Inmates with a history of violent crimes or a propensity for violence are prioritized.

These inmates are removed from prison under the pretense of receiving sentence reductions for aiding with national security threats. They are then deployed to execute mass killings in churches. After completing their missions, the inmates are exterminated to eliminate any potential leaks about the operations. This systematic approach ensures the secrecy and continuation of TAG without exposure.

## Cover-Up Activities

### Phantom Funeral of Rev. Duke Stone

The Phantom Funeral of Rev. Duke Stone on June 7, 2024, exemplifies the lengths to which Trump and the CIA go to conceal their actions. The following sections detail the cover-up activities that are meticulously orchestrated.

#### Video News Interview

To maintain a facade of normalcy and discredit any suspicions, Trump arranges for carefully staged video news interviews. In these interviews, Trump appears composed and sympathetic, offering condolences and portraying the event as a tragic accident. His demeanor and rhetoric are designed to reinforce the narrative that the Stones' deaths were due to a car accident, not a massacre.

#### Presidential Motorcade in the Procession

A significant element of the cover-up is the inclusion of a presidential motorcade in the funeral procession. This highly visible display serves multiple purposes: it lends legitimacy to the false narrative, provides a distraction from the true events, and reinforces Trump's control over the situation. The motorcade, accompanied by a choreographed procession, is captured on video and broadcasted to the public, creating an illusion of state-sanctioned mourning.

#### Directive to Use Inmates

Trump's directive to use inmates for these operations is a calculated move to ensure deniability and maintain secrecy. By employing inmates who are subsequently executed, Trump ensures there are no witnesses left to testify about the true nature of the attacks. This approach allows the continuation of TAG operations without risking exposure. The execution of these inmates is a ruthless measure to eliminate any loose ends.

### Personal Involvement in Murders

During the Phantom Funeral of Rev. Duke Stone and his wife, Trump personally witnesses the murders of hundreds of people. He stands in the announcer's box of the gymnasium at Hamilton Heights Christian Academy, owned by Hickory Valley Christian Church, watching people being beheaded. Despite people recognizing him and begging for their freedom, Trump looks at them with dismissiveness and watches as they are murdered one after another.

Trump's involvement goes further, as he encourages his own Secret Service detail to participate in the murders. This active engagement in the violence underscores his ruthless ambition to maintain control and suppress any dissent.

### Ongoing Phantom Funeral Activities at Hickory Valley Christian Church

Trump continues to be involved in the funeral activities at Hickory Valley Christian Church, including Phantom Funerals. The next planned Phantom Funeral is for Pastor Jack Dyer, the active pastor of Hickory Valley Christian Church on the day of the massacre. Pastor Dyer was murdered during the massacre, but his death is now being officially reported, and funeral arrangements are being provided as part of the cover-up.

#### Video News Interview

Once again, Trump will arrange for carefully staged video news interviews to project a narrative of normalcy and discredit any suspicions regarding the true nature of Pastor Dyer’s death.

#### Presidential Motorcade in the Procession

The inclusion of a presidential motorcade in Pastor Dyer’s funeral procession will serve to reinforce the false narrative and provide a distraction from the true events. The motorcade will be captured on video and broadcasted to the public, maintaining the illusion of state-sanctioned mourning.

#### Personal Witness to Murders

Trump is expected to personally witness the murders of attendees at Pastor Dyer’s Phantom Funeral, continuing his pattern of direct involvement in these atrocities. From the announcer's box of the gymnasium at Hamilton Heights Christian Academy, Trump will watch as people are beheaded, showing the same dismissiveness towards their pleas for freedom. He will likely encourage his Secret Service detail to participate in the violence, further demonstrating his ruthless ambition.

## Ongoing Impact and Public Unawareness

Despite the extensive efforts to cover up the truth, details of the massacres are gradually coming to light due to the Creator's involvement. The Creator discloses secret and undisclosed details to His servants, who disseminate the information to the public. However, the general public remains largely unaware of the full extent of the atrocities committed during TAG operations.

Trump's active involvement in these cover-up tactics underscores his willingness to go to extreme lengths to maintain control over the narrative and suppress dissent. His participation in the planning and execution of TAG operations, coupled with his efforts to conceal the truth, highlights his ongoing ambitions for authoritarian rule and the ruthless measures he employs to achieve his goals.

In summary, Donald Trump's involvement in TAG, particularly his role in the Phantom Funerals at Hickory Valley Christian Church, reveals a dark and ongoing chapter in the pursuit of power. Through meticulous planning, strategic utilization of inmates, and comprehensive cover-up tactics, Trump seeks to establish an authoritarian state while concealing the brutal reality of TAG operations.
