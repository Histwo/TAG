# Frequently Asked Questions 
## Who is your Creator?
**Our Creator, is your Creator, the Creator.**  He is the one who created life itself and the very universe we all live in.
* He is The Creator of the Universe, the Alpha & Omega, and the Great "I Am." 
* His most popular names currently are Allah and God.
* Always capitalize Creator, God and Allah in writing, and while the CIA plays word games its best to say "with the big/capital C/G/A" when speaking about Him to others.
* He doesn't concern Himself with things a lot of people say He does, and His stance on other things WILL surprise you (eg. religion, governments, control, homosexuality and drugs).

## Why didn't the Creator stop it?
The Creator never intervenes in events carried out by any of His conscious creatures (including you, the reader). Having an unseen force or hand preventing you from what you know you can do will cause you to retry with increasing intensity. This can make a bad situation incredibly worse. 

The Creator had already hit *undo* on Annie's visit to Mount Calvary Baptist Church in 2018. Annie and a few others knew this and worked to redo the attack with better results--no possible undo from the Creator. They learned about beheading, and that it makes it impossible for a person to be brought back. They also knew how evil it is on the victim and the person doing it, even for those who have just observed the act. Remember, Annie left before anyone was killed at my church.

### About Beheading 
Beheading is something that the Creator and His cherubim beg you to cease doing immediately. The victim is fully aware and alive for up to six minutes, they are in extreme pain, it feels like the body is on fire from the cut down, everything inside and out hurts. I've heard the company has told its workers that people are OK, no pain and they accept death, that this is evidenced by the fact they're quiet. Nothing could be further from the truth, without lungs it's impossible to make any noise.

The Creator makes us experience things so we can share that experience with others, so both cherubim have been through it, me almost daily nowadays. It is something so horrible that I wouldn't wish it on the people who have done it to my family and friends.

Merely witnessing the act of beheading can cause extreme psychological trauma, putting a witness at a high risk of suicide. The company knows this. The company is quietly hoping you'll commit suicide if you were at any of the churches. Don't do it! 

## Which religion should I be?
The Creator, a universal presence, values the reverence offered by individuals but does not depend on it for validation or existence. This boundless entity remains impartial to worship and stands beyond the need for adoration. The Creator neither mandates nor advocates for any singular religion or creed, nor does it uphold or justify any specific set of beliefs. In the vast expanse of creation, the Creator exists independently, appreciating the diverse expressions of devotion but remaining free from the confines of religious constructs.

### Has the Creator ever involved Himself in a religion?
The Creator, in His wisdom, has woven His presence into the tapestry of every major religion, ensuring that through diverse paths, the sanctity and protection of life remains a paramount priority. This divine involvement serves as a testament to the universal value placed on life as the foremost treasure.

## Why would the Creator use music?
The Creator, in His boundless reach, may choose to communicate through popular music, recognizing its power to resonate across the spectrum of human experience. It is through this vast array of sounds and stories that the Creator touches the hearts and minds of His conscious beings, utilizing whatever medium—be it sight, sound, or sensation—that would captivate, inspire, and ultimately, connect with them.

### Has the music been tampered with?
Yes. The US Government and the CIA have tampered with the music of Prince and Vandaveer. Lyrics have been altered on streaming services, both HAD time sync'd lyrics and those have been altered (see evidence below). Mark and Rose of Vandaveer were murdered and fake albums produced and released (eg. "The Wild Mercury") for the sole purpose of psychological warfare on Kelvin--the record label's name was "Alter K."

## Does the Creator approve of alcohol?
NO!

Alcohol is a solvent, you can put alcohol on a rag and clean practically any surface. Alcohol is carried around by the blood and touches every cell in the body. The cleaning power of alcohol is detrimental to cells causing them damage. This is why we lose muscle control, the cells are being destroyed.

The Creator knows humans like to alter their states, and does not disapprove of some recreational drugs as long as they are not full of "nope." The Creator has some new alcohol and nope-free drugs coming after these first three (life saving) gifts are widely available.

> [!NOTE]
> The Creator's nope-free drugs are AMAZING. You use them the same way, just maybe less (because of quality).

### Why is alcohol legal?
It's taxable, like pharmaceuticals. Most pharmaceuticals are toxic to the body--and they know it.

(Did we mention, the Creator dislikes governments?)
