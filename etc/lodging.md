## Motel 6 Decatur 
2572 Candler Road 
Decatur, Georgia 

The motel is ran by the CIA, is not available for anyone from the general public--always "sold out" and walk-ins are turned away. 

## Legacy at Riverdale 
6603 Church Street (see note)
Riverdale, Georgia 

This residential apartment community is  ran by the CIA as a "kill facility." 

> [!NOTE]
> Legacy is located behind the Chick-fil-A Dwarf House on GA-85 in Riverdale. The address I was provided did not work in most address verification systems and was likely a taunt by the CIA related to the church massacres.

## Phoenix House 
1296 Murphy Avenue 
Atlanta, Georgia 

This residential apartment complex is ran by the FBI. 

### Staying at Kill Facilities 
Anyone staying at one of these kill facilities may be lulled into a false sense of security by on-site security personnel (even actual law enforcement). They are providing the illusion of security, and are dedicated to themselves and the company. They can and do kill "company men" too or military personnel.

Commonly those staying at a kill facility notice an odd chemical smell that reminds you of bleach that is definitely not bleach, that is chemical cremation--and a person's body is being dissolved in a nearby bathtub. 

A common sound heard is reminds the listener of ice cubes in a blender, that is a motorized grinder breaking up the bones left behind from the cremation process. The ground bones are generally disposed of on or next to the property.

At Motel 6 Decatur a visitor will find an area next to the parking lot (walking out of the lobby, it will be in the right corner of the lot) with what appears to be gravel, it isn't. Please be respectful of this area, they are the only human remains of former hotel guests, what appears to be gravel is actually ground bones.

> "As A Matter of Fact" by Vandaveer. When Main says "I scattered the ashes", the song is detailing a PsyOp wherein they brought the "ashes" of my immediate family and nieces to Motel 6 and placed them in an area where I would smoke and discarded my cigarette butts. Main was told to make me smoke there and then tell me after the fact what was there and who they brought in just for me.
