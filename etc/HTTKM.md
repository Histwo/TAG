# How They're Trying To Kill Me Now
## Step One (Overnight)
They spent the night talking to my subconscious, I woke hearing "angels" in my room and craving a cigarette very badly. Having none (they knew) and only fifty cents (they knew) I had only one place to go from Phoenix House (their rent free place they gave me to live).

## Step Two
Coordinate with the store's owner to not open on time and make sure my subconscious would "sit there" and wait.

# Step Three
Hit me repeatedly while I wait.

# Step Four
Go to plan X and have the other store's owner and an associate come out with a chemical attack.

# Step Five
When it failed, instruct my subconscious to "go to New York." So I'd kill myself.
