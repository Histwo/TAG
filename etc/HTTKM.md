# How They're Trying To Kill Me Now
## Step One (Overnight)
They spent the night talking to my subconscious, I woke hearing "[angels](https://mega.nz/file/IfVlXYLK#_BsjohE4q3erNi-Gk4uOGBbgZQyhZ3Du5D1cvsJxBgg)" in my room and craving a cigarette very badly. Having none (they knew) and only fifty cents (they knew) I had only one place to go from Phoenix House (their rent free place they gave me to live).

## Step Two
Coordinate with the store's owner to not open on time and make sure my subconscious would "sit there" and wait.

# Step Three
Hit me repeatedly while I wait.

# Step Four
Go to plan X and have the other store's owner and an associate come out with a chemical attack.

# Step Five
When it failed, instruct my subconscious to "go to New York." So I'd kill myself.

New York as the image they posted in my Twitter feed tells my subconscious to "pull it in" (which shrinks my dick), something they can do when taught how. Conversely, Florida tells him to "push it all back out."

(You don't wanna know what happened when my subconscious took the "last train north, waaaay up north" in Vandaveer's "Nature of out Kind.")

# I Had Enough!
## Hard Hitting Interview 
After walking around picking up poisoned cigarette butts left around for me (part public service, part my craving wouldn't stop) I walked back to find the store I wanted to go to was open, over thirty minutes late, again ... convenient.

I decided to [interview the hitman](https://youtu.be/SQL96WWmG44?si=ee7Sy5zPeUOqgg1e). [backup copy](https://mega.nz/file/IfVlXYLK#_BsjohE4q3erNi-Gk4uOGBbgZQyhZ3Du5D1cvsJxBgg)

## The FBI Responds... "Give him his dick back!"

Went to Krispy Kreme to get my free dozen donuts (get the app!), and they were waiting. His parking was very slow, and all out of the way, and most importantly, right where I was walking. Then I noticed the tag and realized why.

The FBI knew that video of their personnel was now online. In a very small building there are two stores, one company (with cigarettes) the other bureau (without)--they work alot together.
