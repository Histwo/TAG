As long as I grab the pre-poisoned items from Publix, I never have to pay. 

If I grab items not made for me, or if I go to another store, I'm harassed and typically shown the door. Sometimes I'm given money to make it to the store they're expexting me at by the security (off-duty metro Atlanta cops).
