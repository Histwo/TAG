# Hurricane Annie
Annie Jacobsen, also called "Hurricane Annie" by Prince in "Sign of the Times" used the tactics in her book "Surprise, Kill, Vanish" on my church, Mount Calvary Baptist Church and Mount Zion in Kentucky.

To keep her wrath for bigPharma hidden, she formed a group with darker pigment skin to attack the white church, Lexington Bethel Baptist Church, who acted like a good neighbor and checked on my church when she wouldn't stop holding funerals to kill everyone who came. They duplicated the process.

She currently looks a lot older due to cancers that should have put her in the grave, but my Boss, the Creator (most commonly called God) authorized her to get a single-dose fix that made her body eradicate them--one of the three cures (all direct from the Creator) that she keeps killing innocent Americans to keep away from you and your family on behalf big pharma. Annie believes in the cures because she still engages in cloaking today which gave her cancer.

Annie uses the name "Chivy" which she started using after the brutal rape, torture and murder of my friend, Chivette Fournier of Georgetown, SC. Annie chose the name to torment me, Danny made artwork to display around me at the same time Annie showed up in Riverdale. Chivette is pictured on the right alongside her daughter who is also another TAG victim.
