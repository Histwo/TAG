Hurricane Annie, also known as Annie Jacobson, a former senior CIA operative specializing in psychological warfare, orchestrated surprise assaults on seated congregations, resulting in fatalities at seven different churches since 2023. She is now attempting to cover up these incidents. Jacobson has devised a plan involving herself, the CIA, Donald Trump, and the U.S. federal government to prevent the apocalypse. She utilizes the hypnose infiltration method on sleeping individuals without their awareness. Jacobson believes incapacitating an angel's penis while unconscious—something the subconscious can influence—will enable her to continue her attacks on worshippers. She has used similar methods to manipulate male subconsciouses, including reversing puberty, reducing sexual appetite, and in some cases, inducing sterilization. Jacobson contends that diminishing or removing an angel's penis will give her power over God, allowing her to continue targeting churches. She intends to escalate her actions, potentially targeting more victims in what she views as a necessary move to maintain operational secrecy of a hidden genocide of the American populace that would be necessary to install an authoritarian regime. 

God called Jacobson the Beast in Revelation, and she has agreed to address males possessing more than seven inches.
