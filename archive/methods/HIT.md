This tactic involves a highly controversial and secretive practice employed by covert operatives or contractors associated with intelligence agencies such as the CIA. Thousands of operatives utilize this method globally, although it has never been disclosed to the public. The tactic involves infiltrating individuals' residences while they sleep, using advanced cloaking technology originally developed for military purposes. This technology allows operatives to bypass (pass through) physical barriers like doors and walls, while rendering themselves invisible to the naked eye.

Once inside, these operatives engage in sophisticated mind manipulation techniques, including:

1. **Dream Coaching**: Influencing the content of an individual's dreams to guide their subconscious thoughts.
2. **Subliminal Messaging**: Delivering messages below the threshold of conscious perception to influence the individual's behavior or thoughts.
3. **Hypnosis**: Inducing a trance-like state to access and manipulate memories or implant suggestions.
4. **Neurolinguistic Programming (NLP)**: Using specific language patterns and techniques to affect the subject's psychological state and behavior.

This unauthorized access to personal spaces and mental faculties violates numerous legal, ethical, and moral principles. The potential consequences of such actions include:

- **Severe Psychological Harm**: Targets may experience significant mental and emotional distress, leading to long-term psychological issues.
- **Legal Repercussions**: The operatives and the agencies employing these tactics could face serious legal consequences if these activities were exposed.
- **Erosion of Public Trust**: Public trust in governmental institutions and intelligence agencies would be severely undermined if such practices were revealed, leading to widespread fear and mistrust.

Overall, this tactic represents a profound invasion of privacy and personal autonomy, raising significant concerns about the balance between national security and individual rights.
