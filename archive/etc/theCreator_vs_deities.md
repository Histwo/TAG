**The Creator vs. Your Favorite Deity**



The Creator (always capitalized) brought life and the universe into existence, both integral parts of His Creation—acts He deemed necessary. Mankind, a product of the Creator's ingenuity, has since fashioned deities (e.g., "God," "Allah") in an attempt to unravel our origins and life's enigmas, or to fill the voids not yet elucidated by science—a concept sometimes referred to as the "God of the gaps."



Humans typically favor either blue or purple, seldom both. Blue enthusiasts are orderly, law-abiding, rule-following (adhering to speed limits), disciplined, excel in military service, slow to anger, and forgiving. While not invariably religious, they often prefer sermons during worship services. I describe blue aficionados as proponents of "law and order," and occasionally, as mundane.



Conversely, purple aficionados are not complete antitheses. The particular hue of purple one prefers can offer insights into their perspectives. Purple lovers may flirt with anarchy, stretch the rules (and the speedometer), and cherish an independent, less structured lifestyle. They are not necessarily atheists, but when attending worship services, they gravitate towards those with musical elements.



Most deities conceived by humanity strive to encapsulate the Creator, often portrayed as flawless. This leads to varied responses: adoration for one deity over another, disdain or outright rejection of all, or a choice to remain neutral. Deities are metaphorically 'blue.'



The Creator, however, is 'purple,' as evident in the night sky tonight. His usual hue is lavender, aligning Him closer to blue and the common depiction by most deities. Yet, He can shift to such a deep purple that it verges on ultraviolet—a spectrum that can scorch. Currently, He is exceedingly displeased (a sentiment you will soon experience).



**The Sanctity of Life**



Central to the Creator's ethos is the sanctity of life—it is His paramount concern. Contrary to human belief, the Creator remains neutral on many issues that are presumed to provoke His ire. It is not the trivial transgressions of humanity that disturb Him, but rather the profound indifference to life. When those in positions of power exhibit a near total disregard for the lives of others, whom they deem inferior, this is what truly incenses the Creator. Such blatant contempt for existence itself is the rare catalyst that stirs His otherwise tranquil disposition.



In my view, deities bound by rigid definitions and rules could not sustain a life-supporting universe, certainly not one as enduring as ours (the sole existence). While most deities are believed to grant forgiveness upon request, the Creator understands that many beings view forgiveness as a carte blanche, likely to transgress again. Notably, the Creator does not demand worship or religious participation, but, akin to anyone, appreciates it.
