# CIA vs. The Believer

In the world of the Central Intelligence Agency, a powerful entity that seeks to control the masses, a fascinating conflict emerges between its ideology and the belief in a higher power. Let's delve into the key points:

1. **Belief Hindrance**: The CIA acknowledges that belief in a higher power (such as God) poses a challenge to its control. Individuals who hold strong beliefs tend to view the government as neither the ultimate decision maker nor the final judge. Their faith provides an alternative authority, which undermines the CIA’s influence.

2. **Propaganda Consumption**: Interestingly, believers approach propaganda differently from non-believers. While the latter may be more susceptible to manipulation through popular music, sitcoms, and other forms of media, believers remain discerning. Their faith acts as a filter, allowing them to critically evaluate information.

3. **Airwaves and Suggestion**: The CIA recognizes that the airwaves—channels through which information flows—play a crucial role. However, believers appear less influenced by these channels. Perhaps their unwavering faith shields them from subtle suggestions or mind control attempts orchestrated by external forces.

4. **The Dilemma**: The CIA faces a dilemma. On one hand, it desires public funding and approval. On the other, it grapples with the presence of believers within the population. The solution? The CIA continues eliminating believers by and through hidden massacres at places of worship and infiltrating the population of believers using various methods.
