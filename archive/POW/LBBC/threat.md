# Notifications Threat
After posting the first draft of the massacre of Lexington Bethel Baptist Church (A Smith & Wesson Symphony) this notification was received.

There has also been an increased police presence around me.

Additionally, "too good to be true" (as my mother would say) offers have been made to me. Keep in mind, the FBI and their CI's follow me everywhere.

Sorry, but Im not sorry Annie. Those churches were never satanic, and while youve been doing whatever you want there, it has to stop.
