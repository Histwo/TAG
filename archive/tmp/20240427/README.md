## Bathroom
I spent a lot of time in the bathroom thank to Main.  The apartment was 203, which made me think of the hone i grew up in.  It was an AirBNB like so many others I've been in invited to and told it was their home. The shower curtain and bathroom along with the framed art in the bathroom was disturbing so we're other little knickknacks that were conveniently place at eye level. Everything with someone was to remind me of friends and family. 

The bathroom had a framed drawing of all the children that were killed in my family under about 10 to 12 years old.

## Walk from Downtown to Midtown 
Walking to the train station, passed weapons in DJ coffins and many hits and finally (for now) the obligatory dick jokes.

No university from Kentucky would spell thoroughbred this way. The license plate and telephone number proved to me it was all CIA.

More explanation to come.
