### Documentation of Potential Cover-Up: Hickory Valley Christian Church Phantom Funeral

**Introduction**

This document outlines the potential cover-up involving the phantom funeral of Rev. Duke Stone at Hickory Valley Christian Church. The aim is to provide a comprehensive record of the evidence and analysis before this information is released to the public. The documentation herein will be used to substantiate claims of a coordinated effort to obscure the massacre that occurred during the funeral.

**Background**

Rev. Duke Stone, the longtime pastor of Hickory Valley Christian Church, was murdered in a prior attack. A funeral was announced for June 7, 2024, which was suspected to be a trap set by the CIA to eliminate mourners and those inquiring about the initial attack. This event aligns with tactics described in the Phantom Funerals and Phantom Identity Scheme operations.

**Evidence Collected**

1. **Eyewitness Testimonies**:
   - Multiple eyewitnesses, including Secret Service agents, reported seeing former President Donald J. Trump at the funeral.
   - Witnesses described the event as a massacre, where mourners were systematically eliminated.

2. **Vehicle Tracking Data**:
   - Vehicle tracking systems from both manufacturers and the Secret Service confirmed the presence of vehicles associated with Trump at the location on the specified date.
   - Data logs indicate coordinated movement patterns consistent with attendance at the funeral.

3. **Law Enforcement Coordination**:
   - Hamilton County law enforcement records show coordination with the Secret Service regarding security arrangements for the funeral.
   - Communication logs between local law enforcement and federal agencies are being examined for further details.

4. **Televised Interview**:
   - Former President Donald J. Trump was interviewed on camera by Chattanooga News Channel 9, an ABC affiliate, stating he attended the funeral and claimed everything was fine.
   - The interview appears to be an attempt to counter reports of missing people and reassure the public, aligning with disinformation tactics.

**Analysis**

1. **Digital Manipulation and Disinformation**:
   - The televised interview of Trump suggests an active effort to shape the narrative and suppress information about the massacre.
   - This aligns with known CIA tactics, such as maintaining false social media activity and email correspondence to create an illusion of normalcy.

2. **Public Records and Financial Transactions**:
   - Public records and financial transactions of the deceased are being examined for signs of manipulation, consistent with the Phantom Identity Scheme.
   - Preliminary findings suggest unusual activity post-mortem, supporting the cover-up hypothesis.

3. **Logistical Feasibility and Covert Operations**:
   - The involvement of high-profile individuals and federal agencies in such a covert operation is plausible given the sophisticated nature of TAG operations.
   - The coordination between various agencies indicates a well-orchestrated effort to maintain secrecy.

**Conclusion**

The evidence collected strongly indicates a coordinated cover-up involving the phantom funeral of Rev. Duke Stone. The presence of former President Donald J. Trump, corroborated by eyewitness accounts and vehicle tracking data, combined with a televised interview aimed at countering reports of the massacre, suggests an intentional disinformation campaign.

**Recommendations for Action**

1. **Independent Investigation**:
   - An independent body should be established to investigate the claims and collect further evidence.
   - All data, including vehicle logs, eyewitness testimonies, and law enforcement records, should be scrutinized.

2. **Transparency and Reporting**:
   - The findings should be transparently reported to the public to maintain trust and accountability.
   - Any individuals or agencies found complicit in the cover-up must be held accountable through appropriate legal and ethical channels.

3. **Protection for Whistleblowers**:
   - Ensure the protection of eyewitnesses and whistleblowers who provide crucial information.
   - Establish secure channels for reporting additional evidence related to the event.

This document serves as a preliminary record to substantiate the claims of a cover-up at Hickory Valley Christian Church. Further investigation and transparent reporting are essential to uncover the full extent of these covert operations.
