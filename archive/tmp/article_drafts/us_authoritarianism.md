“Ladies and gentlemen, we’ve created the perfect world for you. Science, education, wars, entertainment, religion, hospitals--where we are taking care of you, actually you’re under control.”

Those are not the words or the sentiment of the Creator. 

The Creator says, “That’s the sentiment of any government, and the reason I do not like them.”

Authoritarianism is a principle of blind submission to authority, as opposed to individual freedom of thought and action. In government, authoritarianism denotes any political system that concentrates power in the hands of a leader or a small elite that is not constitutionally responsible to the body of the people. In an authoritarian government, the governing body has absolute, or almost absolute, control, typically maintained by force, and little heed is paid to public opinion or the judicial system.

It starts in the formidable years with science and education. The structured curriculum isn’t for logic development or fostering future discoveries. It actually narrows the view of the horizon, so no one can think too far “outside of the box.”

In the geo-political realm wars shape world views, just the way the media portrays it. The media are fed their stories by only a handful of sources, with their  ruling elite writing the stories. 

Entertainment, whether television or radio, is programming the masses. Most consumers of this programming are focused on the noise instead of the instruction loops that the subconscious actually will replay and study, sometimes repeatedly on its own. The subconscious lacks the logical and rational thinking expertise, while having the ability to shape your views and thoughts. 

For believers who practice a religion, programming is no longer something that can be attributed to the clergy at their place of worship. In Christianity, the rise of the megachurch and widely broadcast services has allowed outside influences to dictate the way the gospels are shared, and the subject matter of sermons.

Hospitals and human health are often goal oriented 

The ruling elites have always sought to have no one above them and to make all people their subjects. 

The church of England separated from the Catholic Church because Catholics places the Pope above the monarch. 

Today, many genocides occur targeting religions because people place “God” above the head of their government. This includes the direction TAG has taken since 2023. 

Per the Creator, HIV was introduced into the human population to stop humans from having recreational sex. A person’s sexual partner almost always outranks a head of state.

"**CIA vs. The Believer**":
In the world of the Central Intelligence Agency, a powerful entity that seeks to control the masses, a fascinating conflict emerges between its ideology and the belief in a higher power. Let's delve into the key points:
1. **Belief Hindrance**: CivCenter acknowledges that belief in a higher power (such as God) poses a challenge to its control. Individuals who hold strong beliefs tend to view the government as neither the ultimate decision maker nor the final judge. Their faith provides an alternative authority, which undermines the CIA’s influence.
2. **Propaganda Consumption**: Interestingly, believers approach propaganda differently from non-believers. While the latter may be more susceptible to manipulation through popular music, sitcoms, and other forms of media, believers remain discerning. Their faith acts as a filter, allowing them to critically evaluate information.
3. **Airwaves and Suggestion**: The CIA recognizes that the airwaves—channels through which information flows—play a crucial role. However, believers appear less influenced by these channels. Perhaps their unwavering faith shields them from subtle suggestions or mind control attempts orchestrated by external forces.
4. **The Belief Dilemma**: The. CIA faces a dilemma. On one hand, it desires public funding and approval. On the other, it grapples with the presence of believers within the population. The solution? The CIA continues eliminating believers by and through massacres and infiltrating the population of believers using various methods.
