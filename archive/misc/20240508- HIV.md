I said a few things about KP the otherpppday, and this morning they're parked right outside my door.

This evening I found out I was supposed to get an HIV test. 

Tonight I got a notification, I'll cover these more later (post-divide) but they always seem to tell me their plans. I'm not even subscribed to that subreddit.

If you must know, my first proof case of Spark was with KP. They have a history of loosing actual results and making up replacements. I was asking the Creator if they're under the same "corporate umbrella" as the other companies behind TAG.  Answer withheld.  I never said anything out loud, my subconscious loves to talk about everything i think about while I'm sleeping.

My mother always said, "Desperate times call for desperate measures."

UPDATE:
I just took off my socks and shoes, and found this! Thry forget that I was given Spark first. Test case dummy #1 (I keep telling y'all that TomTom is his favorite).
