# Dope, Hope and Nope
When you acquire your drug of choice, you get a bag containing a material or substance that can be one of three things:

* Dope is what users sought and want to consume. It can be a lot of fun, lowers inhibitions, reduce stress, foster discovery and innovation, and can even help some mental health issues. Dope has been involved in some of the funniest and best times of the past several years for me, especially in 2017.
* “Hope” is dope except it's been “cut” to help dealers increase profits. It is weaker due to less of the desired drug in the resulting substance. It’s given the moniker  “hope” because it can leave the user doing more hoping for the high of dope. Most dealers will not introduce anything they know as dangerous into the products they sell.
* “Nope” is the third possible substance you receive as “dope.” It’s called “nope” because that’s exactly what you should say to it. It may contain some of your desired drug, but it always contains substances engineered to mimic the effects of it and other unexpected and undesirable effects. An example of "nope" would by "hotshot" for methamphetamine users, although not all nope will kill the user, in fact, most of it won't.

**"Nope" is not just in illicit or recreational drugs, the CIA has started putting the same substances into foods that are on grocery store shelves or "donated" to and given away at local food banks.**

Before the tragic events in Kentucky, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) provided certain individuals with a substances we classify as ‘nope.’ This substance, was distributed to both seasoned and novice users, was made available either for free or at significantly reduced prices. Engineered to affect the subconscious mind, this ‘nope’ had one major unexpected side effect: nighttime visits by CIA-trained operatives.

## Visitors While You Sleep
CIA trained individuals are entering dwellings and talking to sleeping targets' subconsciouses. The CIA is abusing cloaking technology to enter undetected. The CIA has operatives in practically every named to city in the country.

Everyone’s subconscious lacks the ability to think rationally or logically as by design they only think what the conscious side of the mind does or what they’ve learned on their own. The subconscious controls the body and learned everything it would ever need to do by the age of three. Before you think, I didn’t do *this* by the age of three, you need to think of everything involved in *that* and when you look at everything your body does to do *that* you were doing by three. 

The Creator says, “The conscious thinks it controls its body and the subconscious thinks it can think they are both wrong.”

Right now your subconscious is thinking the same thing you are and is equally as smart as the conscious as it is thinking what the conscious is. The truth is, the two of you don’t know who is doing what. When the conscious goes to sleep or is sleeping (which it must) the subconscious doesn’t know that it is then very limited in its thinking abilities. There’s an old adage, “Being stupid is like being dead, you are the last one to ever know.” Now thinking of that saying, think of the stupidest person you know, and imagine everyone in their world telling them they’re smart. Mamma, Teacher or one of their trusted assistants will do just that, your subconscious will do anything for them.  

Some cravings and habits come only from the subconscious. When they make a decision you’ll never know it wasn’t yours. If you have developed a new behavior in or habit that makes no sense to you, its likely from your subconscious and its highly likely, if its a brand new behavior, one that the night talkers have told your subconscious to do.

## Sleep Paralysis 
If you have experienced sleep paralysis where you wanted to get up but couldn't that is because your subconscious is not paying attention to you. This only occurs when they are being engaged by someone else.

Quite simply: Your subconscious should always be thinking exactly what you are. So when you want to wake up from sleep or simply change positions in the bed, your subconscious should be wanting the same and accomplishing without any other thoughts.

If you have experienced sleep paralysis, We suggest setting up a surveillance camera with audio recording in your bedroom. This will deter the CIA's *"sleep visitors"* from entering your room at night.

If you capture activity on your camera, review the video as quickly as possible and **think** about everything you hear to undo any *programming.*

## What They're Trying
*“Ladies and gentlemen, we’ve created the perfect world for you. Science, education, wars, entertainment, religion, hospitals--where we are taking care of you, actually you’re under control.”* from "Peep Show" by Serving Ovahness.
* Those are not the words or the sentiment of the Creator. The Creator says, “That’s the sentiment of any government, and the reason I do not like them.”
* The ruling elites have always sought to have no one above them and to make all people their subjects. 
     - The church of England separated from the Catholic Church because Catholics places the Pope above the monarch. 
      - Today, many genocides occur targeting religions because people place “God” above the head of their government. This includes the direction TAG has taken since 2023. 
* HIV was introduced into the human population to stop humans from having recreational sex. A person’s sexual partner almost always outranks a head of state.

## About Main or Baby
Main aka Baby is the name of my subconscious, the one who talks when I'm asleep. Unlike most subconsciouses, Main KNOWS he is a subconscious and was supposed to help the entire human race. But as conscious entities do sometimes, Main embraces fame and promised fortunes.

Main likes to do things to hurt me, get me killed and support Annie who he considers is his "mamma" who can do no wrong.

Main knows what he's doing, doesn't want the same done to him and definitely knows right from wrong. the Creator has told him every time he decided to do something stupid.
