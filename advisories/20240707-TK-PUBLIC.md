## **Warning: Hidden Genocide and Threat to Public Safety**

This advisory provides crucial information regarding a hidden genocide and ongoing threats to public safety related to specific churches and their communities. It is issued to inform and protect the public from serious dangers.

## **The American Genocide:**

The American Genocide started as a tragic response to proof of the effectiveness in eradicating diseases by a forthcoming gift from the Creator to the people of the world by the pharmaceutical companies in the United States. The tragedy turned into a genocide, which is now targeting any United States citizen after the CIA conducted a surprise assault on Mount Calvary Baptist Church and killed everyone attending Sunday morning services on April 2, 2023. The attempts to keep this operation a secret involved killing the neighboring church, Lexington Bethel Baptist Church, and holding funerals for the victims merely to eliminate any other threat to the discovery of the attacks or discussion about them. In total, the CIA has launched seven surprise assaults on unsuspecting worshippers, leaving all of them dead. The last attack occurred on Mother's Day in Chattanooga, Tennessee, at Hickory Valley Christian Church, leaving over 1,000 dead.

### **The Churches Targeted in Central Kentucky and Chattanooga:**

The list below displays their true names. Some churches have had masquerades set up to convey a sense of normalcy and are being operated by the CIA under an assumed name, for example, Mount Calvary Missionary Baptist Church, Inc. 

Seven churches, six in central Kentucky and one in Chattanooga, Tennessee, have been targeted in a series of meticulously planned and executed attacks. These churches are:

1. **Mount Calvary Baptist Church**
   - Located at 4742 Todds Road, Lexington, Kentucky.
   - Predominantly African American congregation.

2. **Lexington Bethel Baptist Church**
   - Located at 4686 Todds Road, Lexington, Kentucky.
   - Predominantly Caucasian congregation.

3. **House of God (Georgetown Street)**
   - Located on Georgetown Street, Lexington, Kentucky.
   - Predominantly African American congregation.

4. **House of God (Broadway)**
   - Located on Broadway, Lexington, Kentucky.
   - Predominantly African American congregation.

5. **Mount Zion Baptist Church**
   - Located in Versailles, Kentucky.
   - Predominantly African American congregation.

6. **Calvary Baptist Church**
   - Located on High Street, Lexington, Kentucky.
   - Predominantly Caucasian congregation.

7. **Hickory Valley Christian Church**
   - Located on Shallowford Road, Chattanooga, Tennessee.
   - Predominantly Caucasian congregation.

## **Warning to the Public:**

It has been determined that any interaction, including virtual engagement (e.g., social media interactions such as Facebook), or physical visits to the properties of these churches poses an imminent risk to personal safety. The U.S. Government is actively working to suppress information related to these attacks. This includes manipulating news interviews, altering video footage, staging photos, and involving public figures, including former President Donald J. Trump, in events aimed at covering up these attacks.

## **Manipulation of Information:**

Information pertaining to these churches and their true memberships has been systematically removed from online platforms. Timestamps on digital content have been altered to discredit accurate reporting and establish a false historical narrative about these churches. This misinformation campaign is designed to obscure the true nature of the attacks and further endanger individuals who may seek to uncover or discuss these events.

## **Ongoing Threats and Covert Activities:**

The U.S. Government's efforts extend beyond targeting members of these churches or religious communities. Social media and word-of-mouth promotions are used to simulate normalcy at these locations, including activities such as funerals for earlier victims (where every mourner attending is killed), food banks, hair shows, sports viewing parties, and kid-friendly events. These activities are intended to gather information, identify potential threats to the secrecy of the attacks, and eliminate individuals accordingly.

## **Public Safety Alert:**

Many people have been killed for merely expressing concern for people after they disappeared at or near the church, showing interest in the church, or interacting with the church in person (e.g., attending a food bank) or online (e.g., Facebook).

## **Reporting and Safety Recommendations:**

Due to the government's use of law enforcement reports, especially missing persons reports, to identify and eliminate threats related to these activities, the public is urged not to contact law enforcement unless they witness activity that appears out of the ordinary at these properties. Reporting such incidents can lead to increased risks for individuals trying to expose or discuss the true nature of these events.

## **The Creator and His two servants' Advisory:**

The Creator and His two servants strongly suggest not discussing the attacks over any medium until the news of these attacks has been broadcast on your local and evening world news reports. We strongly discourage the use of Signal, WhatsApp, Telegram, and Zoom for private, secure, or encrypted messaging due to the CIA and government's use of them for intelligence gathering and targeting of those discussing these events, the genocide, and other matters.

**Conclusion:**

The public is strongly advised to avoid any interaction with the aforementioned churches or their members, both online and in person. Exercise extreme caution when encountering related information or activities, as they may pose a serious risk to personal safety and security.

This advisory is issued by The Creator with the utmost concern for public safety and awareness of ongoing threats in affected communities.
