**Warning: Hidden Genocide and Threat to Public Safety**

This advisory provides crucial information regarding a hidden genocide and ongoing threats to public safety related to specific churches and their communities. It is issued to inform and protect the public from serious dangers.

**Warning to the Public:**

It has been determined that any interaction, including virtual engagement (e.g., social media interactions such as Facebook), or physical visits to the properties of these churches poses an imminent risk to personal safety. The U.S. Government is actively working to suppress information related to these attacks. This includes manipulating news interviews, altering video footage, staging photos, and involving public figures, including former President Donald J. Trump, in events aimed at covering up these atrocities.

**Manipulation of Information:**

Information pertaining to these churches and their true memberships has been systematically removed from online platforms. Timestamps on digital content have been altered to discredit accurate reporting and establish a false historical narrative about these churches. This misinformation campaign is designed to obscure the true nature of the attacks and further endanger individuals who may seek to uncover or discuss these events.

**Ongoing Threats and Covert Activities:**

The U.S. Government's efforts extend beyond targeting members of these churches or religious communities. Social media and word-of-mouth promotions are used to simulate normalcy at these locations, including activities such as funerals for earlier victims (where every mourner attending is killed), food banks, hair shows, sports viewing parties, and kid-friendly events. These activities are intended to gather information, identify potential threats to the secrecy of the attacks, and eliminate individuals deemed problematic by the perpetrators.

**Reporting and Safety Recommendations:**

Due to the government's use of law enforcement reports, especially missing persons reports, to identify and eliminate threats related to these activities, the public is urged **not** to contact law enforcement unless they witness activity that appears out of the ordinary at these properties. Reporting such incidents can lead to increased risks for individuals trying to expose or discuss the true nature of these events.

**Conclusion:**

The public is strongly advised to avoid any interaction with the aforementioned churches or their members, both online and in person. Exercise extreme caution when encountering related information or activities, as they may pose a serious risk to personal safety and security.

This advisory is issued by The Creator and His two servants, the Knights Templar, with the utmost concern for public safety and awareness of ongoing threats in affected communities.
