# *The Phantom Funeral of Rev. Dr. Duke Stone*

The June sun glared off the sleek black cars of the motorcade as it approached Hickory Valley Christian Church, nestled in suburban Chattanooga. Angela squinted, stepping back onto the sidewalk to watch the convoy arrive. The lead vehicle bore small American flags fluttering on its hood, unmistakably signaling the presence of a high-profile dignitary.

Angela had grown up attending Hickory Valley Christian Church but hadn’t been a regular in years. Still, the church held a special place in her heart, and the passing of Rev. Dr. Duke Stone—her childhood pastor—felt like losing a piece of home.

The congregation of Hickory Valley Christian Church was a close-knit group bound by tradition and faith. The news of Rev. Stone’s and his wife’s untimely deaths in a car accident devastated them. The Stones had led the church for decades and were integral to Hamilton Heights Christian Academy, where Rev. Stone served as principal and his wife worked in the school’s office. They were beloved by students and families alike, leaving an irreplaceable void in the community.

Even after their retirement, the Stones remained active, attending services and offering counsel. Their sudden deaths united the congregation and community in mourning. Over 600 mourners gathered for the funeral—a testament to their impact.

Yet, none of them knew the full truth.

The Stones had not died in a car accident. They, along with the entire congregation present on Mother’s Day, had been executed in a brutal, unexplained assault. The event, which authorities quietly classified as an “incident,” was never investigated. No official statements followed, and the community was left bewildered by the disappearance of the congregation. The circulated cause of death for the Stones remained a fabricated car accident.

As the motorcade pulled into the church lot, murmurs rippled through the gathered mourners.

"Is that...?" someone whispered.

Angela turned to see a small group exchanging bewildered looks. The limo’s door opened, and former President Donald J. Trump stepped out, flanked by Secret Service agents. Gasps swept through the crowd.

## The Arrival  

The shock of Trump’s appearance unsettled the mourners. Though Rev. Stone’s influence was far-reaching, he had never mentioned any connection to Trump in sermons, conversations, or community events.

Angela adjusted her black dress, trying to suppress her unease. It wasn’t inconceivable that Stone’s legacy could have reached high places, but Trump’s presence felt intrusive. The sacred space meant for mourning seemed overshadowed by his celebrity.

The tension followed Angela as she joined the others filing into the sanctuary.

## The Sanctuary  

Inside, the sanctuary felt foreign. The warmth and sense of community Angela remembered were gone, replaced by a chilling coldness. The man at the pulpit was unfamiliar—a stranger to Hickory Valley Christian Church and the Tennessee Valley. Angela assumed he had been installed at the church sometime after she had stopped attending regularly. His demeanor was detached, his voice flat as he read from a prepared script.

The eulogy was impersonal, devoid of any anecdotes about Rev. Stone’s life or ministry. There was no mention of his decades of service or the countless souls he had guided. Worse, there was no prayer—no invocation of God’s comfort, no words of salvation.

The officiant’s abruptness created an uneasy silence. “The service is concluded. Everyone must exit through the side doors,” he said without emotion.

Angela exchanged confused looks with others, but no one dared speak. They silently filed out, the air thick with dread.

## The Trap  

Angela stepped through the side doors and froze. Before she could process her surroundings, a strong hand grabbed her arm.

“Hey!” she yelled, twisting to face her assailant. The man wore a white uniform with a blue stripe and bold letters across the back: *Dept. of Corrections*. Her stomach dropped—these were Georgia state prisoner uniforms. 

As she struggled, Angela caught sight of another prisoner’s back, the letters on their uniform confirming the same origin. Her unease deepened as the reality of the situation sank in.

All around her, mourners were being seized by similarly dressed men. Some prisoners dragged people forward in silence; others barked orders. Angela’s captor tightened his grip, forcing her toward Hamilton Heights Christian Academy’s gymnasium.

The gym had been entirely renovated since the massacre on Mother’s Day. The gleaming hardwood floors, fresh paint, and bright lighting made the space unsettlingly pristine. The upgrades went unnoticed by most mourners, but Angela caught details that didn’t sit right. The announcer’s booth had been replaced with a soundproof, bulletproof structure, and the space felt oddly suited for concealment.

Angela’s dread deepened as she realized the room’s sinister design: it wasn’t a gym anymore. It was a chamber of death.

The gym doors slammed shut.

## The Execution  

Trump entered through the double doors in the back of the gym, flanked by Secret Service agents. He ascended the bleachers slowly, pausing to meet the eyes of various mourners. Many called his name, pleading for freedom. Trump responded only with a dismissive glance.

Reaching the soundproof booth, Trump joined Annie “Hurricane Annie” Jacobsen, infamous for her TAG operations. The pair stood watching as the mourners were forced into a line. Chainsaws roared to life.

Some mourners screamed for answers; others simply wept. None came. The executions began with unrelenting brutality—chainsaws severing heads, blood spraying across the polished floor.

Angela clung to the wall, trembling, until her turn came. She was dragged forward, her eyes locking onto Trump’s unfeeling gaze before she was forced to stand before the executioner.  

As the chainsaw buzzed, Angela began to pray fervently, seeking solace in her final moments. The blade came into contact with her neck, pulling and chewing through the flesh. Her body shook uncontrollably as the chainsaw’s teeth tore through muscles and tendons.  

Halfway through, when her spinal cord was severed, an intense sensation of burning pain erupted throughout her body. It felt as though she were engulfed in flames. She remained acutely aware of every moment as the chainsaw cut through the last strands of muscle and skin.  

Angela’s world spun wildly as her head detached, hitting the ground with a jarring thud that brought a fresh wave of searing pain. Disoriented, she realized she could still see, hear, smell, and taste. Her severed head lay on the floor, her senses heightened in a surreal, nightmarish clarity.  

The metallic tang of blood and spinal fluid mixed with the acrid taste of tissue filled her mouth. The air reeked of gasoline and burnt oil from the chainsaws. She could see the room from a disjointed angle, hear the roar of machines and the screams of others, but her attempts to cry out yielded no sound.  

Her consciousness persisted for what felt like an eternity, though only minutes passed. Angela’s mind raced between flashes of her family, her friends, and her past life. She prayed desperately, asking God how long she would have to endure this torment. She even prayed for the executioners, pleading for their redemption.  

Finally, as her awareness faded, Angela felt an overwhelming sense of cold emptiness—a final, chilling reminder of how loveless the day had become.

The executions continued for hours. Chainsaws buzzed relentlessly, their roar punctuated by the muffled cries of mourners. The final chainsaw powered off around midnight, leaving a suffocating silence in its wake.

## The Cover-Up  

By the next day, the gymnasium was spotless. Operators had dissolved the bodies, ground the bones, and scattered the remains outdoors, ensuring no trace was left. The mourners’ cars were sanitized, repurposed, or discarded without a trace of their owners.

Outside, the funeral procession continued with Secret Service agents driving some of the mourners’ vehicles. The former President's motorcade was given prominent placement. The public saw only a somber ceremony, unaware of the horrors within.

The truth of what transpired at Rev. Dr. Duke Stone's phantom funeral was erased—along with the lives of the mourners. The orchestrators had partially accomplished their goal: the elimination of Rev. Stone's associates to prevent discussion of his out-of-character and unexplained disappearance.
