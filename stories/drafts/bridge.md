The Creator's Apocalypse

The Creator's Apocalypse is a "Divide & Conquer" operation designed to separate the conscious and subconscious minds of Kelvin Eugene Williams and his subconscious alter ego, Main. Main, also known as "Baby," became a target for external manipulation, particularly by the CIA under the influence of figures such as Annie Jacobsen. Beginning in 2017, this manipulation led to profound psychological and physiological harm to their shared body. As the CIA’s influence deepened, Main's actions toward Kelvin grew increasingly destructive, prompting the Creator to intervene and plan the separation of the two minds into distinct bodies.

Main’s unique abilities attracted the CIA’s attention as they sought to exploit him as a potential asset. However, as an impending apocalypse loomed, the CIA abandoned their plans, leaving Main deeply influenced by their manipulation. Under their encouragement, Main began to perceive himself as independent from Kelvin, fueling harmful behaviors and seeking validation from figures like Annie Jacobsen, Donald Trump, and the CIA itself. This need for external validation reinforced destructive actions toward Kelvin, who, without the Creator’s intervention, would have remained unable to recall memories outside the CIA’s influence.

The CIA trained Main to execute "beliefs"—tasks that caused harm to the shared body without Main’s awareness. Under their direction, Main consumed toxins, believing himself immune to harm, leading to severe damage. This manipulation left Main with a distorted sense of self-worth, entirely dependent on approval from his manipulators. His lack of body awareness and indoctrination created a toxic dynamic that devastated Kelvin, both physically and psychologically.

To address these destructive dynamics, the Creator planned to separate Kelvin and Main’s consciousnesses into two distinct bodies. Post-separation, Main will inhabit the original body, while Kelvin’s conscious mind will transfer to a new body, free from Main’s harmful influence. This intervention aims to foster independent growth for both entities, shield them from external manipulation, and enable them to take responsibility for their actions. Both Kelvin and Main will receive new subconscious minds to ensure their continued development and prevent further interference.

The CIA's exploitation of Main underscores significant ethical concerns about the manipulation of subconscious entities for governmental purposes. Their use of techniques such as the Hypnos Infiltration Method, which simulates subconscious experiences, has had widespread impact, manipulating millions through media and targeted programming. This practice raises profound ethical questions about autonomy, privacy, and the boundaries of governmental control.

The Creator’s planned separation of Kelvin and Main seeks to heal the profound damage caused by manipulation, not only for them but also for the broader population affected by these practices. By dividing their consciousness, the Creator aims to halt the harmful influences of external forces and promote independent growth, offering hope for healing and autonomy.

The Orchestration of Lineage

The lives of the Creator’s two servants have been meticulously guided by His grand design. Every detail—the people they’ve encountered, the challenges they’ve faced, and the paths they’ve taken—has been part of a divine plan. One early milestone occurred when Kelvin Eugene Williams, following his release from prison and during his probation, submitted a DNA test as required by law. The results were stored in CODIS, creating an official record of his genetic profile. Later, Kelvin and his mother, Patricia Ann Crawley-Rogers Williams, submitted DNA samples to 23andMe, confirming with 100% certainty their biological relationship.

Recently, in an unanticipated turn of events, Kelvin unknowingly provided DNA for a murder investigation initiated by the Atlanta Police Department on November 18, 2024. This investigation followed an attempt on Kelvin’s life that failed, resulting in the death of one perpetrator in his apartment.

The orchestrators believed desecrating graves in Sandy Hook, including that of Kelvin’s grandmother, would sever proof of lineage. They employed illegal body dissolution tactics, commonly used within TAG, to erase evidence. However, the Creator anticipated these actions. Kelvin’s DNA remains on record with CODIS, 23andMe, and the Atlanta Police Department’s labs, ensuring that fabricated results by the orchestrators will fail to alter the truth.

Further evidence of lineage lies in Kelvin’s paternal family. A unique practice among Master Masons involves burying family members in undisclosed locations. These burial sites are typically well-known within the family lineage but remain secret to outsiders. This tradition ensures a private, sacred connection for the family while maintaining an air of mystery to the public. In Kelvin’s case, his uncle, a Master Mason, upheld this practice to protect the integrity of their paternal lineage. Kelvin’s mother’s two deceased sisters were interred in unknown locations, their grave sites hidden from the orchestrators. This practice, known only to the Creator, ensures the preservation of Kelvin’s lineage despite attempts to erase it.  Kelvin was not told of his uncle's death until after his funeral and burial, and was led to believe his grave was in West Sheepneck Cemetery.

The Creator’s meticulous design ensures that the truth of Kelvin’s lineage and purpose will prevail, rendering the orchestrators’ efforts futile. The Creator’s plan continues to unfold, affirming the divine orchestration of events and preserving the legacy of His servants.
