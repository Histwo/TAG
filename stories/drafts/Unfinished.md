# The Hidden Agenda and The Creator's Intervention

Before dismissing this as just another “fake and discredited hit piece” on President-Elect Donald J. Trump, take a moment to consider whom he has been disregarding lately: Christians, Black people, White people, alpha males, business leaders, the impoverished, politicians who vocally oppose his authoritarian agenda, everyday Americans—and, if you live in central Kentucky or the Tennessee Valley, that neighbor who mysteriously went missing after attending a funeral or visiting a food pantry. They're all dead. Spending just a few minutes reading this could very well save your life.

Consider, too, that Trump has lawyers—his legal team knows how effective a cease-and-desist order can be in quickly halting defamation. Yet Trump has taken no legal action to refute anything I’ve written about him or his role as the chief orchestrator of *The American Genocide*.

Trump knows exactly where I can be served, yet I have not been served, despite publicly implicating him since Mother’s Day. On that day, I documented his participation in a conference call during the execution of over 1,000 worshippers at a suburban Chattanooga church. Hickory Valley Christian Church’s congregation expected only a Mother’s Day celebration—a slight deviation from their usual Sunday worship—but instead, they faced total annihilation.

That was just the beginning. Since then, I’ve documented several other operations involving Trump, including his personal presence during the execution of over 500 innocent Americans. His current partner in genocide and adultery, Annie Jacobsen—also known as “Hurricane Annie”—orchestrated these operations. Whenever Trump is present, she’s right by his side. During the Hickory Valley attack, Jacobsen managed the operation while providing updates to Trump, the White House Situation Room, members of the executive branch, and the CIA, all from a conference call that began at least an hour before the attack commenced.

I suspect the lack of service stems from the fact that I’ve openly told Trump and his associates that I welcome it—and that I’ll violate every letter of it just to force them to take me to court. In the United States, all attorneys are officers of the court. They cannot—and most will not—allow a lie to be presented in court.

For Trump to claim defamation based on what I’ve written, he would have to present a lie to the court—a fact his lawyers would either already know or quickly recognize in his demeanor. His failure to legally challenge or sue me only enhances the credibility of my claims. Tragically, it also further validates them—proving me correct and casting him as Satan, as the Creator calls him in the Book of Revelation.

Trump’s only attempts to silence us at StopTAG is with pressure on GitHub through National Security Letters (NSLs) issued by the FBI that force compliance and non-disclosure of the receipt of one, repeated attempts at eliminating me, and subconscious manipulations by Jacobsen and others at the CIA while I sleep.  Just a few days ago I woke up to find my room filled with Secret Service agents—many of whom had just tried to kill me—with Trump himself overseeing yet another operation aimed at eliminating me.

I am one of the Creator’s servants, the “Great ‘I Am.’” I work directly for the Creator, the Creator of life, the Creator of the universe, the Alpha and the Omega. As Whitney Houston famously sang, “Well, I ain’t nobody’s angel…” but I am the Creator’s. To many who call the Creator by names such as Allah, God, Jehovah, and Yahweh in various monotheistic faiths, that’s exactly who I am, although I prefer the term “divinely-driven asshole.” If you want the sweet, kind one, you need to talk to the other of the Creator’s two servants—but he doesn’t talk much—by design.

> **Revelation 12:1-6 (NIV)**
> A great sign appeared in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun, with the moon under her feet and a crown of twelve stars on her head. She was pregnant and cried out in pain as she was about to give birth.  
> Then another sign appeared in heaven: an enormous red dragon with seven heads and ten horns and seven crowns on its heads. Its tail swept a third of the stars out of the sky and flung them to the earth.  
> **The dragon stood in front of the woman who was about to give birth, so that it might devour her child the moment he was born.**  
> She gave birth to a son, a male child, who "will rule all the nations with an iron scepter." And her child was snatched up to God and to his throne.  
> The woman fled into the wilderness to a place prepared for her by God, where she might be taken care of for 1,260 days.  

In Revelation 12, I’m referred to as the “woman.” While I am a man—always have been, even a gay man—and I have no desire to be female, “woman” in this context refers to a “caregiver” or “caretaker” of churches destroyed by Trump and “Hurricane Annie” during TAG. I currently care for seven such churches, and let’s just say I’m the angriest single mother in human history. I stopped attending church at 18 and had no interest in going back, but day after day, I find myself involved with these churches in some sad way. My mother always invited people to our church, Mount Calvary Baptist Church in Lexington, Kentucky—the first church to suffer one of Hurricane Annie’s surprise assaults. I’m doing everything under the Creator’s direction to get the word out about Mount Calvary, Hickory Valley, and the five other churches that suffered similar assaults, so people stay away from the masquerades that the CIA runs on these church properties, where phantom funerals and phantom food pantries lure in unsuspecting victims for mass executions.

Just a few days ago, I woke up in my own bed to find a roomful of Secret Service agents, many of whom had just tried to kill me, with Trump himself overseeing the operation. Trump had made a TOP-SECRET trip to Atlanta, one of several he’s made to my residence in recent months. His presence that day fulfilled Biblical prophecy in Revelation 12. Though males cannot bear children, I am unique in that I must be separated from my subconscious mind. The two of us will live in separate, distinct bodies. The “man child” I am giving birth to is myself with a different subconscious mind and body, one that will expose *The American Genocide* and bring Trump and the others to justice. Trump knew the operation would fail—he’s aware of too many such attempts to eliminate the Creator’s servants. His second objective that day was to ensure my subconscious mind remained loyal to him. I have no idea if they talked, or if the conversation only occurred with one of the people who invade my private dwelling during sleep to manipulate my subconscious, just as they do with the American public—whether in person (rarely) or via broadcast media.

The Creator has only two servants, what most of the world would call angels. In Revelation, there are many others, but “angels” are synonymous with “servants.” An angel on the opposing team is technically a “demon”—and they refer to me as that—correctly. However, my team is overseen by the Creator, who first created life, and then, out of necessity, created a universe to support that life. The Creator’s two servants are solely focused on protecting and fostering life.

In Revelation, the Creator’s two servants are first called the “angel of the church in Smyrna” and the “angel of the church in Philadelphia.” Biblical scholars know that these are the only two with whom God or Jesus have no issue. Our first appearance is in Genesis 19, the story of Sodom and Gomorrah. TAG is a situation far worse than Sodom and Gomorrah, and it was never about homosexuality.

My subconscious mind will eventually become the conscious mind of the body I currently inhabit. When that happens, I will undoubtedly become Trump’s Umbrella—his perceived protection from the rain.

> **Revelation 17:9-11 (NIV)**
> This calls for a mind with wisdom. The seven heads are seven hills on which the woman sits.  
> They are also seven kings. Five have fallen, one is, the other has not yet come; but when he does come, he must remain for only a little while.  
> The beast who once was, and now is not, is an eighth king. He belongs to the seven and is going to his destruction.  
> The ten horns you saw are ten kings who have not yet received a kingdom, but who for one hour will receive authority as kings along with the beast.  

> [!NOTE]
> The woman (the whore) in Revelation 17 is different from the woman (the caregiver) in Revelation 12. 

Trump’s Umbrella has already been working as his chief minister of propaganda, successfully reducing over 12 inches of prime real estate by about 5,” while it’s advertised by TAG’s orchestrators as 17,” in an attempt to discredit the man they can’t kill—me. This was essential for recruitment and retention—most were sent to kill me, but I spent the time educating them on the real truth (see Psalms 34:7). This is why the Creator felt it necessary to mention it in Revelation 17:9-11. Those verses were intentional. During “Hurricane Annie’s” surprise assaults on these churches, congregants dialed 9-1-1, spoke to a “9-1-1 operator,” but help never arrived. Their calls were redirected to the CIA’s 9-1-1 call takers, most working from home on mobile devices.

Trump knows the rain is coming—the period just before the sunshine or “Son shine,” when he and the other conspirators will face divine justice.

Trump was involved in the Sandy Hook, TN massacre. This was Tennessee—the land my family inhabited since the time of Lincoln, and which we owned outright shortly thereafter. On that land, along West Sheepneck Road, stood Orr Chapel, and beside it were two cemeteries: Orr Chapel Cemetery and my family’s private Sheepneck Cemetery. After a large group of my family members were eliminated in an aerial irradiation, the church was destroyed, and the cemeteries desecrated. Once it was discovered that the CIA had identified and eliminated anyone associated with the church or with loved ones in the cemetery, Maury County, Tennessee began suffering from “disappearances.” But let’s call it what it is: these were eliminations. Ninety-nine percent of Maury County’s recent disappearances were murder victims of *The American Genocide*.

Trump’s Umbrella has a very important job in Maury County—discrediting me, saying everything is fine, and asking everyone to “move along” because “there’s nothing to see here.”

Trump’s Umbrella is apparently going to take a DNA test to prove his family lineage. The only problem is, it won’t match a DNA test kit that my mother and I took for fun years ago and submitted to 23andMe. If they were to draw blood from the body I currently inhabit, it would match, but they likely won’t, as it won’t be a 100% match to Patricia Ann Crawley-Rogers Williams (my mother), nor to Lila Elizabeth Crawley Richardson (my grandmother), whose grave is the first one I’ve been instructed by the Creator to exhume.

The Creator orchestrated the lives and deaths of many of my family members, including my uncle, Felix Clennon Rogers, an Army vet who was buried in West Sheepneck Cemetery with honors from the military. It was a haunting presence throughout our family’s history—of all who know us as family. The DNA result also proves that Trump’s claim to “pure lineage” is false. He will claim otherwise if he can pull it together. If not, he’ll continue the charade by building an illusion through artificial intelligence.
