The Rain: Trump’s Umbrella vs A Mighty Wind 

Before you disregard this as another “fake and discredited hit piece” on President-Elect Donald J. Trump, consider who he’s been disregarding lately: Christians, Black people, White people, alpha males, business leaders, the impoverished, politicians who vocally oppose him and his authoritarian agenda, everyday Americans, and, if you live in central Kentucky or the Tennessee Valley, that neighbor of yours who unexpectedly went missing after attending a funeral or visiting a food pantry—they’re all dead.  Spending a couple minutes reading this may just save your life. 

You should also consider that Trump has lawyers, and both he and his legal team understand how effective a cease-and-desist order can be in quickly halting defamation of character. Yet, Trump has taken no legal action to refute anything I’ve written about him or his role as the chief orchestrator of The American Genocide. 

Trump knows exactly where I can be served, yet I haven’t been served despite publicly implicating him since this past Mother’s Day. On that day, I documented his participation in a conference call during the execution of over 1,000 worshippers at a suburban Chattanooga church. Hickory Valley Christian Church’s congregation expected only a Mother’s Day celebration as a slight deviation from their usual Sunday morning worship—only to face total annihilation. 

That was just the beginning. Since then, I’ve documented several other recent activities involving Trump, including his personal presence during the execution of over 500 innocent Americans. His current secret lover, Annie Jacobsen—also known as “Hurricane Annie”—orchestrated these operations, providing updates to Trump, the White House Situation Room, members of the executive branch, and the CIA. 

Here’s a proofread and refined version of your text: 

I’m guessing the lack of service stems from the fact that I’ve told him and his posse I welcome it—and that I’ll violate every letter of it just to force them to take me to court. In the United States, all attorneys are officers of the court and cannot, and most will not, allow a lie to be brought before it. 

For Trump to claim defamation of character based on what I’ve been writing and distributing, he would be presenting a lie to the court—a fact his lawyers would either already know or quickly recognize in his demeanor. His continued failure to legally refute or sue me for my public writings about him only enhances their credibility and authenticity. Unfortunately, it also further validates my claims—tragically proving me correct and furthermore casting him as Satan, that is what the Creator calls him. 

A few days ago, I woke up to find my room filled with Secret Service agents, many of whom were trying to eliminate me, with Trump himself overseeing the entire operation. (I told you he knows exactly where I am.) 

I am one of the Great “I Am’s” servants. I work directly for the Creator, the Creator of life, the Creator of the universe, the Alpha and the Omega. In the words of Whitney Houston, “Well, I ain't nobody's angel...” but to many who call the Creator: Allah, God, Jehovah, and Yahweh in various monotheistic faiths, that’s exactly what I am. I prefer the term, “divinely-driven asshole.” If you want the sweet, kind one, you need to talk to the other of the Creator’s two servants, but he doesn’t talk that much—by design. 

In the book of Revelation, specifically Revelation 12, I’m the “woman.” I am a man, I’ve always been a male, even a gay male, and I have no desire to be female. “Woman” in this context means a “caregiver” or “caretaker” of churches that have been destroyed by Trump and “Hurricane Annie” during TAG. I’ve got 7 under my care, and I’m the most pissed off single mother in human history. 

A few days ago, I woke up to a roomful of Secret Service Agents, many of whom were trying to eliminate me with Trump himself overseeing the entire operation. (I told you he knows exactly where I am.) Trump standing there fulfilled Biblical prophecy in Revelation 12. Although males cannot bear or have children, I’m a bit unique because I have to be separated from my subconscious. The two of us will live in separate and distinct bodies. One is represented in Revelation 12 as Michael, and I will be myself in a different body, continuing my pursuit as one of Trump’s angels. Trump knew the operation was going to fail; he’s personally witnessed too many of these operations to eliminate the Creator’s two servants. 

The Creator has only two servants, what most of the world would call angels. In Revelation, there are many others, but “angels” are synonymous with “servants.” 

In Revelation, the Creator’s two servants are first called the “angel of the church in Smyrna” and the “angel of the church in Philadelphia.” Biblical scholars and readers of Revelation know those are the only two with whom God nor Jesus have a problem. Our first appearance is in Genesis 19, the story of Sodom and Gomorrah. TAG is a situation far worse than Sodom and Gomorrah, and it was never about homosexuality. 

My subconscious mind will become the conscious mind of the body I currently inhabit, and at that time, it will undoubtedly become Trump’s Umbrella—what he considers will be his protection from the rain. 

Trump’s Umbrella has already been at work as his chief minister of propaganda, successfully reducing over 12” of prime real estate by about 5”, while it’s advertised by TAG’s orchestrators as 17” to discredit the man they cannot kill as someone who couldn’t work for the Creator. This was essential in recruitment and retention—most were sent to kill me, and I’d spend the time educating them as to the real truth (see Psalms 34:7). This is why the Creator felt it necessary to mention it in Revelation 17:9-11. The verses 9-11 were intentional too. During “Hurricane Annie’s” surprise assaults on these churches, congregants dial 9-1-1, speak to a “9-1-1 operator,” but help never arrives. Their calls had been redirected to the Central Intelligence Agency’s 9-1-1 call takers, most working from home answering calls on their mobile devices. 

Trump knows the rain is coming—a period just before the sunshine or “Son shine” when he and the six others are going to face some divine justice. 

Trump was involved with the Sandy Hook, TN massacre. Note: That’s Tennessee. The land my family inhabited since the time of Lincoln and owned shortly thereafter, outright. On that land, along West Sheepneck Road, stood Orr Chapel, and beside it was two cemeteries, Orr Chapel Cemetery and my family’s private one, Sheepneck Cemetery. After a large group of my family members were eliminated in an aerial irradiation, the church—not really attended by only my family—was destroyed, and the cemeteries desecrated. Once it was discovered the CIA identified and eliminated anyone associated with the church or had loved ones in the cemetery, Maury County, Tennessee has suffered heavily with “disappearances.” But let’s call a spade a spade: they were eliminations. 99% of Maury County’s recent disappearances were murder victims in The American Genocide. 

Trump’s Umbrella has a very important job in Maury County—discrediting Michael, saying everything is just fine and asking everyone to “move along” because “there’s nothing to see here.” 

Trump’s Umbrella is apparently going to be taking a DNA test to prove his family lineage. The only problem is, it will not match a DNA test kit that my mother and I took for fun years ago and submitted to 23andMe. If they were to draw blood from the body I’m currently inhabiting, it would match, but they likely won’t, given it won’t be a 100% match to Patricia Ann Crawley-Rogers Williams, the woman who gave birth to and raised me, nor to Lila Elizabeth Crawley Richardson, her mother and my grandmother, whose grave is the first one I planned on exhuming. The Creator has instructed such, as Lila and Patricia both Serva Materna Divinae, maternal servants of the divine. One was buried in Sheepneck Cemetery with a one-of-a-kind headstone (read: extremely well documented by a large monument company that still exists), and the other provided me with strict instructions to bury her there after her demise.
