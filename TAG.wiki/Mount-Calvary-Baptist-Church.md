# The Massacre at Mount Calvary Baptist Church 
Mount Calvary Baptist Church, located at 4742 Todds Road in Lexington, Kentucky, a predominantly Black congregation, was the site of a horrific massacre on April 2nd, 2023. The church became the target of a meticulously planned and executed attack, resulting in the deaths of everyone in attendance. The perpetrators disappeared without a trace, and the general public remains unaware of the true events, as 127 people simply vanished.

Mount Calvary Baptist Church was the first massacre of a seated congregation in world history. Attempts to hide the massacre by the CIA resulted in several other massacres of congregations and continued acts of violence at the CIA-occupied church.

## Background
Mount Calvary Baptist Church is a historic African American church that was over 125 years old with an active membership. At the time of the massacre, the Rev. Dr. Felix G. Williams, III had been the pastor for over 40 years. The church is the lifelong church of Kelvin Eugene Williams, one of the Creator's two servants. Kelvin is also the cousin of the pastor.

## Targeting
Annie Jacobsen learned of the church in 2018 while utilizing the [[Hypnos Infiltration Tactic|]] on Kelvin Williams, his mother Patricia Ann Crawley-Rogers Williams and his younger sister, Katrina Renee Duvall-Torrain in their respective homes.

Jacobsen targeted the church after the Sandy Hook Massacre out of fear that Kelvin would return to his church family to prove the CIA was impersonating members of his family through the CIA's [[hotel scheme|Hotels]]. Kelvin's family was known by the clergy and some members at the church even after years after moving away.

## Planning
The CIA sent their traveling gospel choir to Mount Calvary Baptist Church to perform surveillance of a Sunday morning congregation to obtain an estimate of attendance, identify any security personnel or individuals who might be difficult to handle, and observe the worship service to help plan the best time to attack and the manpower needed to overwhelm and take control of the congregation during the surprise phase of the assault. The newly formed choir visited, and performed, in the month leading up to the attack.

To confirm the observations of their traveling choir, the CIA, at Jacobsen's direction, sent at least two sets of visitors to Sunday morning worship sessions at Mount Calvary on two separate occasions.

## Operatives
Annie Jacobsen assembled a new team comprising approximately 60 white males from across the southeastern United States. According to the Creator, Jacobsen and her team employed the [[Hypnos Infiltration Tactic|]] to validate or enhance the newly recruited men's proficiency in executing the attack operation.

## Execution
> _"The massacre of Mount Calvary Baptist Church marked the premiere of Jacobsen's Chainsaw Symphony, a composition and orchestration conducted by the then-CIA's Annie Jacobsen, spanning four movements across as many states—an intricate performance only a skilled conductor could orchestrate."_ -- the Creator.

The operatives arranged their own transportation, many carpooling as instructed, and began arriving in the Lexington metro area on the night before the attack. Operatives were provided lodging. 

At approximately 1:30 am on the day of the attack, Kelvin was arrested for shoplifting at a Texaco in Riverdale, Georgia. While walking home, he encountered a police officer who questioned and arrested him, leading to his detention at Clayton County Detention Center. Kelvin faced multiple attempts on his life while in custody.

Jacobsen arrived at Mount Calvary Baptist Church around 11:30am to attend the morning worship session. She sat quietly and directed everything from her cell phone by messaging colleagues, including the Director of the CIA, and certain operatives.

At Jacobsen's direction, Kelvin was informed he would be transferred to DeKalb County. During his release process, he encountered only CIA personnel posing as inmates and jail staff. No charges were pressed in Clayton County.  Upon release, he was placed in a DeKalb County Sheriff's SUV.  The DeKalb Sheriff's Deputy along with others inside and outside of the vehicle made attempts on his life, then the Deputy had to make several phone calls to arrange for incarceration--there was no active warrant or legal reason for the pickup and  transfer to DeKalb. 

Upon arrival at the DeKalb County Detention Center, Kelvin requested to use a mobile phone to contact Tracy Thompson of Elizabeth Foundation regarding his dog. Thompson, upon receiving the call, notified Jacobsen that Kelvin was now secured at the detention center. Jacobsen then initiated the  [[Emergency Services Interruption Tactic|]]. 

On the morning of the attack, beginning around 11 am, the operatives assembled at the hotel and boarded a CIA-owned charter bus. The bus departed the hotel en route to the church around noon. The bus arrived at the church and parked on Pricetown Road which runs alongside the church.

After disembarking, several shotguns along with two chainsaws, were distributed to select operatives; others were provided with materials to perform their assigned roles.

### Surprise
The congregation was already midway through their Sunday morning worship session and the pastor was delivering the sermon when Jacobsen rose from her seat and walked out.  A few moments later she returned with the operatives and burst into the sanctuary. Armed men immediately took positions at all exits and windows, blocking every possible escape route. Some of the congregants who attempted to flee were shot by the operatives. Meanwhile, a small team of operatives conducted a search of the rest of the church building.

Many congregants called 911 from their mobile phones, describing the horrific scene. They were told help was on the way, but none realized they were speaking with CIA operatives instead of Lexington-Fayette County’s Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP)—a centralized facility responsible for answering and routing emergency calls. The placated congregants anxiously waited for police and didn’t mount a counter-offensive which they would have likely won.

Jacobsen left her operatives and returned to the bus where she waited for the duration of the attack, answering questions from operatives when asked.

### Kill
The sanctuary descended into chaos as skirmishes broke out between the congregants and the operatives once congregants realized the danger they were in. Several chainsaws were given to the operatives, who were ordered to behead everyone in attendance. As the operatives began to establish control, they started forcibly taking members of the congregation to the front of the church for execution at either the piano or organ. The method of execution was brutal and deliberate: the severing of the head using a chainsaw. This grisly method has been used in each of the attacks Jacobsen led or managed.

### Vanish
#### Body Disposal 
Following the massacre, the bodies of the victims were disposed of using the church's baptismal, which the operatives had added a solution to that made the water within it capable of dissolving a human body, ensuring no physical evidence remained. 

#### Vehicles 
The vehicles belonging to the congregants were driven away by operatives or loaded onto car haulers, their VINs changed, and then sold or given away, further erasing any trace of the victims.

#### Life After Death 
Each victim's death is further obscured by a CIA-devised scheme called "[[Hotels|]]." The scheme effectively makes victims appear "alive" after their murder.

# The Massacre of Mount Calvary Baptist Church in Lexington, Kentucky

_“A massacre is the killing of a large number of people, especially those who are not involved in any fighting or have no way of defending themselves. A massacre is generally considered to be morally unacceptable, especially when perpetrated by a group of political actors against defenseless victims.”_ - Wikipedia

The massacre was the first massacre of a church's congregation in [TAG (The American Genocide)](https://github.com/TAGIsNoGame/TAG)

## Location 

Mount Calvary Baptist Church is located at 4742 Todds Road in Lexington, KY. The church is in a remote area of Lexington with very low traffic and very few, if any, routine police patrols. The location of Mount Calvary Baptist Church almost makes it ideal for such a massacre. The church’s address conveys urban area, however, if Fayette county were any other county, the church would be in a rural suburb called Pricetown (see [Google Maps](https://maps.app.goo.gl/nZgjiHDMm8bGsM2e7?g_st=ic)).  Lexington is unique in that the city of Lexington spans every square inch of Fayette county.

## Anatomy of Attack

Around 1:30am on the morning of the attack, Kelvin was arrested in Riverdale, Georgia for shoplifting. 



The alleged incident occurred at the Texaco, and while walking back to his apartment, Kelvin walked past a police officer driving slowly on GA-85. As Kelvin turned onto Howard St, the officer pulled up behind him and turned on the lights. Kelvin was questioned, arrested and taken to Clayton County Jail.  Kelvin had multiple attempts made on his life inside the jail. 



The next morning Kelvin was awaken and told he was being transported to DeKalb county. A few minutes later he was escorted out of the housing unit. Kelvin never encountered a single inmate from the jail's general population at anytime during the release process, only CIA personnel posing as inmates and jail employees.  Upon release, Kelvin was placed in the back of a DeKalb County Sheriff's SUV. 



According to the Creator, Annie Jacobsen arrived at Mount Calvary Baptist Church around 11:45 am. Jacobsen was welcomed in by the ushers and found a seat in the rear of the church. Jacobsen focused mainly on her mobile phone. 



Upon arrival at the DeKalb County Detention Center, Kelvin asked the transporting deputy if he could use his mobile phone. Kelvin was concerned about a dog he had, that was locked in a pet carrier in his apartment. 



Kelvin contacted Tracy Thompson of Elizabeth Foundation and asked her if she could help him by caring for the dog while he was incarcerated. Tracy urged him to re-home the dog instead of a temporary shelter, Kelvin agreed. 



After Thompson received the call from Kelvin, she sent a message to Jacobsen advising that Kelvin was now secured at DeKalb County Detention Center. Jacobsen then sent a message to the supervisor of the group outside. The group made up of approximately fifty men and one woman were dressed in all black, few were actual CIA employees, and almost none knew they would be attacking a church. 



Four men armed with shotguns quietly entered the church through the exterior door of the anteroom outside of the women’s restroom on the northwest corner of the church, two of the men went into the adjoining men’s anteroom. The rear entrances are the lesser used entrances with the women’s anteroom being the one generally used due to the relative  location of the access street and parking lot. 



During services, the doors between the anterooms and the  sanctuary are closed to prevent interruptions from other activities that may be occurring in the rear of the church. 



The group that was waiting outside came from the rear parking lot and gathered outside on the front steps of the church, largely undetected by the congregation. 



![floorplan.png](https://github.com/serviCreator/TAG/assets/155787787/6c64dc8c-53ee-4e5b-9d57-3f260584ef40)



Jacobsen got up from her seat in the sanctuary and went outside and met up with the team gathering in front of the church. Within the sanctuary, congregants noticed men amassing outside the windows on the western side of the church that runs along Pricetown Lane and in front of the church through opened windows. It gave the congregants that seen it the sense that the church was being surrounded, unnerving some. 



Most of the congregation jumped to its feet when they heard the noise from the group gathering in the vestibule. They were alarmed by the number of people in the small room that normally has no more than five or so waiting at any given time, also by the fact that by that point, late in the service, usually no one is trying to enter the sanctuary. 



Jacobsen had obtained a bullhorn outside and announced that she absolutely hated the sermon and that everyone in the church needed to die. 



The individuals who were in the anterooms in the back of the church, opened the doors to the sanctuary with their shotguns at the ready, and the group that had amassed in the vestibule loudly entered the sanctuary. They hurled racial slurs that made the congregation realize that their entrance was not any law enforcement action. After the group's entrance, Jacobsen left the church and went to an area hotel.



Although not a law enforcement action, Kelvin has learned that some in the group were law enforcement, a few of them were at the scene when Kelvin was arrested earlier that morning.



Many in the congregation attempted to call 911 from their mobile phones and their calls were answered on mobile phones  by CIA personnel in another location on mobile phones, not by Lexington-Fayette Urban County Government or any other public safety answering point (PSAP).



Several of the CIA's personnel also attempted to call 911 when they realized they were launching an attack on a congregation during their worship services. 

Jacobsen had directed that the utilization of the [[Emergency Services Interruption Tactic|]] begin about ten minutes prior to the bus carrying the operatives arrived at the church.

Inside, the normally peaceful sanctuary became chaotic and terrifying for the congregation almost immediately as the CIA’s personnel acted as instructed.  They raped, pillaged and otherwise terrorized the congregation. Parents did everything to shield their children from the things going on around them. 



In the remote church, far from routine police patrols and while following the orders of Annie Jacobsen the CIA’s personnel began killing. Members of the congregation were taken to the front of the church and beheaded using chainsaws at the piano and organ’s benches. 



The bodies of those slain were placed in the baptismal which is at the front of the church. The baptismal’s water had a formulation added to it which made it chemically cremate the bodies. 



### “Frying Chicken”

The initial operation is referred to by the CIA and others as “Frying Chicken.” The moniker was applied to the operation after the fact because the congregants did fight for their lives. 



## Aftermath 

### Mount Calvary Missionary Baptist Church, Inc.

In May 2024 the CIA formed Mount Calvary Missionary Baptist Church, Inc. a charade church with a reported address of of 4743 Todds Road in Lexington. Videos produced by the charade and posted on its Facebook page (see warnings) clearly show the interior of Mount Calvary Baptist Church at 4742 Todds Road.



The sanctuary shows evidence of damages from the massacre and a shoddy restoration.

#### Missionary

The new business entity, as the name suggests, calls itself “Mount Calvary Missionary Baptist Church, Inc.” The *Missionary* was an insult to the Creator’s **Mission** number 23 for Life on Earth.
