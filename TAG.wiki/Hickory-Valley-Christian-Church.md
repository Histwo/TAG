# The Massacre at Hickory Valley Christian Church


Hickory Valley Christian Church, located in Chattanooga, Tennessee, a predominantly white congregation that also operates Hamilton Heights Christian Academy, a private high school, was the site of a horrific massacre on Mother's Day, May 12, 2024. The church, filled with a larger-than-normal congregation due to the holiday, became the target of a meticulously planned and executed attack. Over 1,000 congregants and one teacher were killed in the massacre. 

## Background 
Hickory Valley Christian Church was targeted after Kelvin Williams, concerned for the safety of the church and its school, attempted to warn Pastor Duke Stone about a potential threat. Kelvin Williams is one of the Creator's two servants and a lifelong member of [[Mount Calvary Baptist Church|]] in Lexington, KY. He is now the only known living member of this historic church, which was tragically attacked and massacred by operatives under the direction of Annie Jacobsen of the CIA on Sunday, April 2nd, 2023, at the height of the church's morning worship service. At the time of the attack, [[Mount Calvary Baptist Church|]] was over 140 years old with a very active congregation. Kelvin is also the cousin of the church's pastor, the Rev. Dr. Felix G. Williams, III. Kelvin considered Duke Stone a friend and had previously worked for Hickory Valley and its school.

In 2004, Kelvin was introduced to Duke Stone by Bonnie Bush Ford of Wildwood, Georgia, a retired elementary school teacher and principal, and a cousin of former Presidents George H. W. Bush and George W. Bush. Bonnie, a close friend, convinced Kelvin to assist Hamilton Heights Christian Academy in upgrading their computer lab, a necessity the school couldn't afford but desperately needed. The school prioritized providing education and assistance to children, irrespective of their parents' financial capabilities, often offering free tuition and transportation at the church's expense. 

Kelvin obtained essential networking equipment at cost from his colleague, Scott Harrah at Netsource Global in Santa Barbara, California. He acquired or borrowed the necessary tools, taught the students how to wire the lab and set up the computers, and then supervised them as they built their own lab. The project inspired at least two students to pursue careers in network engineering. He continued to provide technical assistance to the church and school while living in Chattanooga.

### Targeting
Pastor Jack Dyer, upon receiving Kelvin’s warning, consulted with Pastor Duke Stone, who vouched for Kelvin's credibility. Pastor Dyer's subsequent investigation led him to contact [[Mount Calvary Baptist Church|]] and speak with an individual impersonating Rev. Dr. Felix G. Williams, III. Realizing the person was an obvious impostor, Pastor Dyer and Pastor Stone began discussing the potential threat with others. When Annie Jacobsen, who personally conducted her own investigation, learned of the communication between Kelvin and the church, she considered them a significant threat to exposing their covert activities and decided to neutralize this risk.

According to the Creator, Jacobsen gathered intelligence from Williams, Stone, and Dyer herself utilizing the [[Hypnos Infiltration Tactic|]].

## Planning
### Operatives
One hundred inmates from various prisons within the Georgia Department of Corrections were handpicked for the mission. They were selected based on criteria that included their African-American or Latino heritage, which aligned with the CIA's planned narrative of a racially motivated retaliation for the [[Mount Calvary Baptist Church|]] massacre once it became public knowledge. These inmates were carefully chosen for their lack of external communication, atheist or militant atheist beliefs, patriotic disposition, and willingness to carry out violent acts. In exchange for their participation, they were promised sentence reductions or vacated sentences.  

To conceal their true purpose, they informed fellow inmates that they were being transferred to Clayton County Detention Center due to court appearances, a common reason for sentenced inmates to be relocated to a county facility. The inmates were transferred to Clayton County Detention Center in the two weeks before the attack.

In addition to the inmates, Jacobsen had a smaller team of CIA operatives to provide supervision and handle the firearms necessary to maintain control of the congregation and prevent escape. As congregants who attempted to escape had to be shot.

## Execution 

Just before the attack began, a conference bridge was established, connecting various stakeholders including the White House situation room, which provided periodic updates to President Biden, former President [[Donald J. Trump|Authoritarianism]] himself, the Director of the FBI, and the Director of the CIA. Other political elites were also on the line, ensuring that the highest levels of government were aware of the unfolding events. Jacobsen divided her time between conducting another of her chainsaw symphonies and updating the attendees during the conference call. Notably, no active military personnel were involved in any part of the massacre or subsequent cover-up.

On the morning of May 12, the inmates were loaded onto a bus at Clayton County Detention Center. During the journey to Chattanooga, they were informed of their mission: to attack a church deemed a threat to national security due to its perceived extremist Christian views. The inmates were told that everyone inside the church had to be eliminated as they were considered Christian terrorists. Although misleading, the briefing was intended to ensure their compliance once at Hickory Valley Christian Church and not to be informational. 

### Surprise
The congregation was already midway through their Sunday morning worship session when the operatives burst into the sanctuary. Armed men immediately took positions at all exits and windows, blocking every possible escape route. Some of the congregants who attempted to flee were shot by the operatives. Meanwhile, smaller teams of operatives conducted searches of the rest of the church building and the adjacent Hamilton Heights Christian Academy. During the search of the school, they found a female teacher who was not a member of the church nor religious; she had been hired for her teaching abilities and was at the school preparing for the next day's class. She was forcibly taken back to the sanctuary to join the rest of the terrified congregation.

Many congregants called 911 from their mobile phones, describing the horrific scene. They were told help was on the way, but none realized they were speaking with CIA operatives instead of Hamilton County’s Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP)—a centralized facility responsible for answering and routing emergency calls--due to the [[FBI & CIA's Emergency Services Interruption Tactic|Emergency Services Interruption Tactic]]. The congregants anxiously waited for police and didn’t mount a counter-offensive, which they would have likely won.

### Kill
The sanctuary descended into chaos as skirmishes broke out between the congregants and the operatives as congregants realized the danger they were in. Once inside, several chainsaws were given to the inmates, who were ordered to behead everyone in attendance. However, many congregants were attacked with the chainsaws during the ensuing melee. As the operatives began to establish control, they started forcibly taking members of the congregation to the back of the church for decapitation. Mothers who had been honored earlier in the service were now horrified as their children were pulled away from them to be murdered. The method of execution was brutal and deliberate: decapitation using a chainsaw, Jacobsen’s preferred method for such operations. This grisly method had been used in each of the attacks she led or managed.

### Vanish
#### Body Disposal 
Following the massacre, the bodies of the victims were disposed of using church's baptismal which the operatives had added a solution to that made the water within it capable of dissolving a human body, ensuring no physical evidence remained. 

#### Vehicles 
The vehicles belonging to the congregants were loaded onto car haulers, their VINs changed, and then sold or given away, further erasing any trace of the victims. 

#### Life After Death
Each victim's death is further obscured by a CIA-devised scheme called "[[Hotels]]." The scheme effectively makes  victims appear "alive" after their murder. 

#### Fate of Inmates
The inmates, upon returning to Clayton County Detention Center, were executed with poisonous gas in their cell block, ensuring their silence and eliminating any potential leaks about the operation. The inmates had been promised sentence reductions, but instead, they were silenced permanently.

The largest gas chamber designed for terminating human life is located in cell block 8600 within the Clayton County Detention Center.

## Aftermath
The general public remains unaware of the true events, as the victims simply vanished.
