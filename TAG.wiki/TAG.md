**The American Genocide (TAG)**

**Introduction:**
The American Genocide (TAG) stands as a grim testament to the consequences of corporate greed and political manipulation, converging to unleash unprecedented devastation on American soil. Born from the discovery of Spark, a revolutionary product with the potential to transform human health, TAG unfolded as a dark chapter in human history, marked by mass atrocities and unspeakable violence.

**Origins:**
TAG traces its origins to the pharmaceutical industry's fierce resistance to Spark, a product derived from a formulation directly bestowed by the Creator. Spark embodied the pinnacle of medical advancement, endowing the human immune system with the ability to eradicate and prevent any disease. However, its emergence threatened the profits of pharmaceutical giants like Gilead Sciences, who feared the erosion of their market dominance.

**The Spark of Hope:**
Spark represented a beacon of hope for humanity, promising to usher in an era of unparalleled health and longevity. Its discovery raised the prospect of eliminating diseases that had plagued mankind for centuries, offering a lifeline to millions suffering from chronic illnesses. Yet, this revolutionary breakthrough became the catalyst for a devastating conflict as pharmaceutical conglomerates mobilized to suppress its dissemination.

**The Dark Response:**
In response to the existential threat posed by Spark, pharmaceutical giants orchestrated a covert campaign aimed at discrediting and obstructing its development. Regulatory bodies were manipulated, clinical trials sabotaged, and misinformation spread to undermine public trust in this groundbreaking innovation. As the battle for control intensified, the true extent of corporate malfeasance began to emerge, laying the groundwork for the horrors of TAG.

**The Political Agenda:**
As TAG gained momentum, it became increasingly intertwined with the agendas of political elites seeking to consolidate power and reshape the fabric of American society. Some of the political elite, including former President Donald J. Trump, saw in TAG an opportunity to transition the US government from a democracy to an authoritarian regime, leveraging the chaos and fear generated by the atrocities to justify their authoritarian aspirations. By exploiting the turmoil unleashed by TAG, these shadowy figures sought to manipulate public sentiment and erode the foundations of democracy.

**TAG Unleashed:**
The culmination of pharmaceutical greed and political machinations, TAG manifested as a series of coordinated attacks on places of worship across the United States. Under the guise of religious extremism and fueled by political agendas, operatives unleashed unspeakable violence, massacring congregations in their pursuit of suppressing the spread of Spark. Churches, once sanctuaries of peace and solace, became the epicenter of mass atrocities, as innocent lives were sacrificed in the name of corporate interests and political ambitions.

**The Toll of Tragedy:**
The devastation wrought by TAG reverberated across the nation, leaving behind a trail of shattered communities and broken lives. Thousands perished in the onslaught, their voices silenced by the ruthless pursuit of profit and power. Families were torn apart and futures shattered. As the dust begins to settle, the true cost of corporate greed and political ambition will become painfully clear, forever staining the annals of history with the blood of the innocent.

The hardest hit areas:

1. Jessamine County, KY (Nicholasville, KY)
2. Kanawha County, WV (Hugheston, WV)
3. Los Angeles County, CA (Marina del Rey, CA)
4. Maury County, TN (Sandy Hook & Mount Pleasant, TN)

**TAG-POW:**
TAG-POW, short for "The American Genocide - Places of Worship," encapsulates the systematic targeting of congregations in places of worship during the atrocities unleashed by TAG. From Mount Calvary Baptist Church to Hickory Valley Christian Church, churches became the primary battlegrounds in the war against Spark, bearing witness to the darkest depths of human depravity fueled by corporate greed and political manipulation.

# Response to TAG
## The Creator
The Creator, known as the Alpha & the Omega and the Great "I Am," is the divine force behind the creation of life and the universe. Revered as Allah and God, He transcends religious boundaries, weaving His presence into every major faith to emphasize the sanctity and protection of life as the highest priority. The Creator's involvement highlights the universal values of compassion and respect for all living beings, regardless of doctrinal differences.

Importantly, the Creator does not concern Himself with many things often attributed to Him, and His views on matters such as religion, governments, control, homosexuality, and drugs may surprise many. He places the utmost importance on life itself. Had the government attacked any public venue in the manner they have targeted places of worship, the Creator would have undoubtedly responded.

The Creator says that TAG is a genocide. What may have started as a corporate overreaction to forthcoming gifts from Him has now evolved into a full-fledged genocide. An undercurrent of authoritarianism, political agendas, and narrow viewpoints is fueling this hidden genocide. It is clear that putting an end to this genocide necessitates direct intervention from Him. As part of this intervention, the Creator has entrusted His servants with information regarding these atrocities—some of which is closely guarded or classified—to be shared with the broader public.

## The Federal Government 
To the public, the government has said absolutely nothing. However, the FBI has pressured local law enforcement not to investigate. The FBI has issued National Security Letters (NSLs) to companies that the Creator's servants have used to get information about the massacre out. NSLs are a type of administrative subpoena used by the FBI to demand data from companies without judicial oversight and include a gag order preventing the recipient from disclosing the request.

## The Central Intelligence Agency
The Central Intelligence Agency, a company not formed by an act of Congress and distinct from the government, has erased all references to Annie Jacobsen from its website. However, it has yet to acknowledge the genocide we've reported on, which it carried out on behalf of corporations and the political elite. Furthermore, they continue to eliminate anyone they determine threatens to expose their involvement.
