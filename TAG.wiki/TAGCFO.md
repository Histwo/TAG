# Covert Funeral Operations (CFOs)

**Overview:**
Covert Funeral Operations (CFOs) are an extension of TAG-POW attacks, used by the CIA to maintain secrecy and eliminate those who might uncover the truth behind the initial massacres at places of worship. These operations are meticulously designed to ensure that any individuals seeking information or mourning the loss of victims are systematically silenced.

**Tactics and Methods:**

1. **Impersonation and Initial Contact:**
   - Following a TAG-POW attack, the CIA impersonates the clergy and staff of the targeted place of worship (PoW).
   - Phone lines are answered by operatives posing as clergy or staff, creating an illusion of normalcy.
   - Callers inquiring about victims are told that the victims are not present, and their information is gathered for follow-up.

2. **Return Calls and Deceptive Information:**
   - Some callers receive return calls informing them of the victim's death, with false details about the manner and location of death.
   - Funeral arrangements are provided, with dates and times based on the operatives' schedules.

3. **Spread of Information and Social Engineering:**
   - Recipients of death notices often contact other known associates of the victim, spreading the false information.
   - This social engineering tactic ensures that a wider circle is drawn into the operation, increasing the number of potential targets.

4. **CAV Funerals and Continued Acts of Violence:**
   - The funerals, labeled as Continued Acts of Violence (CAV), are traps designed to eliminate mourners.
   - Attendees of these CAV funerals are systematically killed, often upon entry to the PoW.
   - These acts prevent people from realizing that the original PoW attack resulted in the disappearance of everyone present, averting suspicions of a massacre.

5. **Cover-Up and Prevention of Realization:**
   - The goal of CFOs is to prevent the emergence of groups of concerned individuals who might piece together that a massacre occurred.
   - By eliminating those who inquire or mourn, the CIA effectively suppresses the spread of information about the original TAG-POW attacks.

6. **Multiple Decedents and Targeted Eliminations:**
   - CFOs can involve funerals for multiple decedents, maximizing the impact and ensuring a broader cover-up.
   - These operations are not intended to spread fear but to silence anyone who cares enough to inquire about the victims.

**Impact:**
Covert Funeral Operations are a ruthless and calculated method to maintain the secrecy of TAG-POW attacks and ensure the continued suppression of any potential dissent or discovery of the true nature of these atrocities. By systematically eliminating those who seek the truth, the CIA aims to prevent any awareness of the massacres and maintain their covert operations without detection.
