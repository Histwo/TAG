# Report on the Phantom Funerals of Senator Marsha Blackburn

## Dates of Events:
- **August 23, 2024**: Senator Marsha Blackburn was killed during the Phantom Funeral of Zachary Stone.
- **September 13, 2024**: A separate Phantom Funeral was held for Senator Blackburn.

## Overview

The Phantom Funerals held in 2024 were part of a covert strategy orchestrated by the CIA, under pressure from former President Donald J. Trump, to eliminate political opposition. The funerals were designed to function as mass executions of mourners, primarily targeting those who could oppose an authoritarian regime in the United States. Senator Marsha Blackburn, a Republican senator from Tennessee, was killed at one of these events, and a second Phantom Funeral was staged in her name to eliminate additional political figures.

## Senator Marsha Blackburn's Death: August 23, 2024

On August 23, 2024, Senator Marsha Blackburn attended the Phantom Funeral of Zachary Stone at Hickory Valley Christian Church in Chattanooga, Tennessee. The event was carefully planned by the CIA as a covert execution of mourners, utilizing sentenced inmates to carry out the killings. Senator Blackburn, along with several other mourners, was killed during this massacre.

The execution at this event followed the typical process of these covert operations. Mourners were seated in the sanctuary when inmate operatives launched a surprise assault. Small groups were taken to the gymnasium of Hamilton Heights Christian Academy, adjacent to the church, where they were beheaded using chainsaws. This method of execution was part of the ongoing acts of genocide that had been carried out at the church in previous operations.

## Phantom Funeral for Marsha Blackburn: September 13, 2024

On September 13, 2024, a Phantom Funeral was staged in Senator Blackburn's name at the same location, Hickory Valley Christian Church. This second event was designed to eliminate additional political figures who had either opposed Trump or were likely to resist an authoritarian regime. Trump had provided a list of politicians and associates to be targeted, many of whom were coerced into attending the event.

## Shift in Tactics Due to Fear of Creator’s Intervention

President Joe Biden, Donald Trump, Speaker Nancy Pelosi, CIA Director William Burns, and Annie Jacobsen ("Hurricane Annie") were present at the September 13 funeral, ostensibly to oversee the operation. Their presence was necessary to ensure the elimination of Blackburn’s associates and to suppress any discussion of her disappearance. The overall aim was to further hide The American Genocide (TAG) from public scrutiny.

As the mourners awaited the start of the service, the CIA’s typical plan of beheading mourners was set into motion. However, just as the inmate operatives launched their surprise assault, the White House Situation Room notified President Biden’s assistant of a potential intervention at Phoenix House by the Creator and His two servants.

In response to this potential intervention, President Biden ordered a rapid change in tactics. Concerned that the operation would be disrupted, Biden instructed the Secret Service to take over the execution process immediately. The Secret Service, acting under emergency orders, assembled a firing squad in the gymnasium and executed both the inmates and mourners as swiftly as possible.

## Collapse of the Gymnasium Wall

While the firing squad did not cause the collapse of the gymnasium wall, the wall's destruction was engineered as part of a broader attempt to discredit reports made by the Creator and His two servants regarding The American Genocide and the authoritarian agenda driving it. The wall's collapse, which buried many of the victims, was intended to obscure the true nature of the massacre and undermine the credibility of any external reporting on the incident.

The collapse served to both conceal the bodies and add confusion to the sequence of events, making it difficult to discern the true cause of death for many victims. This manipulation of the scene was meant to cover up the involvement of the CIA and Secret Service, deflect attention from the authoritarian agenda, and weaken any opposition to the regime.

## Conclusion

The Phantom Funerals of Senator Marsha Blackburn were part of a broader strategy of political elimination designed to suppress opposition to authoritarian rule in the United States. The events were carefully coordinated by the CIA under Trump’s influence and carried out with the assistance of inmates and, later, the Secret Service. These covert operations reflect a calculated effort to conceal the truth, discredit the Creator's intervention, and ensure that dissent is silenced.
