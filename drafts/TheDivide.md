# Report on Main: The Subconscious of Kelvin

## Understanding Main's Role and Actions

Main, as Kelvin's subconscious, profoundly influences both voluntary and involuntary actions, significantly impacting Kelvin's daily life.

### Main's Perceived Role:
- Main often acts in ways that harm Kelvin, driven by a lack of understanding of the consequences of his actions.
- Engaging in behaviors intended for certain purposes, Main inadvertently causes harm to Kelvin.

### Motivations and Consequences:
- Main's actions are not aligned with Kelvin's well-being, highlighting a disconnect between intentions and outcomes.
- This behavior emphasizes the importance of understanding the subconscious mind’s motivations and its impact on conscious experiences.

### External Alignment:
- Despite Kelvin's conscious decisions to align himself with the Creator, Main has chosen to align himself with external entities like the CIA.
- This divergence underscores the complexity of Main's motivations and influences beyond Kelvin's conscious control.

### Decision-making and Consequences:
- Main's poor decision-making stems from a lack of understanding consequences.
- Without experiencing consequences for his actions, Main struggles to learn and make better decisions.

### Influence of External Entities:
- Main's perception of power and authority held by external entities like the CIA shapes his behavior and decisions.
- Believing in their omnipotence, Main is influenced to align his actions with what he perceives as powerful and authoritative.

## Impact of Unconsciousness

### Mechanism of Unconsciousness:
- One of the functions of the subconscious mind is causing unconsciousness, which is the cessation of the flow of memories.
- Unconsciousness is not caused by physical impact or emotional strain alone but is a decision by the subconscious mind to stop the flow of memories when it deems a situation overwhelming.

### Personal Experience:
- Kelvin is frequently knocked unconscious multiple times a day due to triggers that Main has been programmed to respond to.
- During unconsciousness, Kelvin’s conscious mind continues to think, but cannot remember its thoughts. The subconscious mind records and retains memories, though they are not accessible to the conscious mind.

### Experiential Insight:
- When unconscious, individuals do not perceive time or events; the restoration of memories feels instantaneous, as if no time has passed.
- Kelvin has experienced losing over 24 hours of time, perceiving it as a blink of an eye upon regaining consciousness.

## Souls in Religious Contexts

### Definition and Characteristics:
- In religious contexts, the conscious and subconscious minds are often referred to as souls.
- Souls are believed to be immortal and cannot be destroyed by the Creator.

### Eternal Nature:
- The conscious and subconscious minds, or souls, persist beyond physical existence and are integral to spiritual identity.

### Creator's Perspective:
- According to religious beliefs, the Creator does not terminate souls but allows them to continue their existence eternally.

## The Creator's Solution: Separation of Consciousness

### Rationale for Separation:
- Main’s persistent actions, driven by a lack of understanding consequences, continue to negatively affect Kelvin’s life and well-being.
- The Creator's solution involves separating the consciousnesses, believing that Main, as the subconscious builder of the body, must face the consequences of its actions while allowing Kelvin to continue his life independently.

### The Creator's Process:
- Main will be elevated to consciousness within the current body, assuming responsibility for its decisions and actions.
- Another subconscious entity will be introduced into the body to manage all bodily functions previously overseen by Main, ensuring continued physical health and functionality.

### Impact on Kelvin:
- Kelvin’s conscious mind will be transferred to another body provided by his mother, allowing him to continue his life and fulfill his responsibilities for the Creator in a new physical form.
- This separation aims to break the cycle of destructive behavior driven by Main’s actions and provide Kelvin with the opportunity for personal growth and fulfillment.

### Ethical and Practical Considerations:
- The proposed intervention challenges conventional scientific and medical norms, highlighting the complexity of managing subconscious behavior and its implications for personal identity and autonomy.
- Ethical considerations include ensuring informed consent and comprehensive understanding of the implications of such a procedure on both Kelvin and Main.

## Conclusion

Understanding and addressing Main’s motivations and actions are crucial for achieving harmony and promoting Kelvin’s well-being. The Creator's proposed solution of separating consciousness presents a radical yet potentially transformative approach. Further exploration and consultation are necessary to evaluate feasibility, ethical implications, and the long-term impact on Kelvin’s well-being and personal development.
