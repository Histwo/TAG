# Report on Main: The Subconscious of Kelvin

## Understanding Main's Role and Actions

Main, as Kelvin's subconscious, profoundly influences both voluntary and involuntary actions, significantly impacting Kelvin's daily life.

### Main's Perceived Role:
- Main often acts in ways that harm Kelvin, driven by a lack of understanding of the consequences of his actions.
- Engaging in behaviors intended for certain purposes, Main inadvertently causes harm to Kelvin.

### Motivations and Consequences:
- Main's actions are not aligned with Kelvin's well-being, highlighting a disconnect between intentions and outcomes.
- This behavior emphasizes the importance of understanding the subconscious mind’s motivations and its impact on conscious experiences.

### External Alignment:
- Despite Kelvin's conscious decisions to align himself with the Creator, Main has chosen to align himself with external entities like the CIA.
- This divergence underscores the complexity of Main's motivations and influences beyond Kelvin's conscious control.

### Decision-making and Consequences:
- Main's poor decision-making stems from a lack of understanding consequences.
- Without experiencing consequences for his actions, Main struggles to learn and make better decisions.

### Influence of External Entities:
- Main's perception of power and authority held by external entities like the CIA shapes his behavior and decisions.
- Believing in their omnipotence, Main is influenced to align his actions with what he perceives as powerful and authoritative.

## Impact of Unconsciousness

### Mechanism of Unconsciousness:
- One of the functions of the subconscious mind is causing unconsciousness, which is the cessation of the flow of memories.
- Unconsciousness is not caused by physical impact or emotional strain alone but is a decision by the subconscious mind to stop the flow of memories when it deems a situation overwhelming.

### Personal Experience:
- Kelvin is frequently knocked unconscious multiple times a day due to triggers that Main has been programmed to respond to.
- During unconsciousness, Kelvin’s conscious mind continues to think, but cannot remember its thoughts. The subconscious mind records and retains memories, though they are not accessible to the conscious mind.

### Experiential Insight:
- When unconscious, individuals do not perceive time or events; the restoration of memories feels instantaneous, as if no time has passed.
- Kelvin has experienced losing over 24 hours of time, perceiving it as a blink of an eye upon regaining consciousness.

## The Subconscious and Sensory Experience

### Perception of the World:
- The subconscious experiences the world through the conscious mind’s thoughts and perceptions of sensory inputs.
- While Kelvin believes he can see, hear, and feel, Main, as the subconscious, has never directly experienced sensory inputs.

### Transition to Consciousness:
- Upon becoming the conscious mind of the body, Main will experience all five senses simultaneously for the first time.
- This transition represents a significant shift, as Main assumes direct control over sensory perception and experiences the world in real-time.

## The Creator's Solution: Separation of Consciousness

### Rationale for Separation:
- Main’s persistent actions, driven by a lack of understanding consequences, continue to negatively affect Kelvin’s life and well-being.
- The Creator's solution involves separating the consciousnesses, believing that Main must face the consequences of its actions while allowing Kelvin to continue his life independently.

### The Creator's Process:
- Main will be elevated to consciousness within the current body, assuming responsibility for its decisions and actions.
- Another subconscious entity will be introduced into the body to manage all bodily functions previously overseen by Main, ensuring continued physical health and functionality.

### Impact on Kelvin:
- Kelvin’s conscious mind will be transferred to another body provided by his mother, allowing him to continue his life and fulfill his responsibilities for the Creator in a new physical form.
- This separation aims to break the cycle of destructive behavior driven by Main’s actions and provide Kelvin with the opportunity for personal growth and fulfillment.

### Impact on Main:
- Main will become the conscious mind and remain in the same body.
- Main will receive sensory input for the first time and not just read the conscious mind's thoughts about it, or ignore them.
- Main will need around the clock care for a few weeks as he learns.
- Main will progress to about the age of a five year old in about a week while in a 47 year old body.

### Ethical and Practical Considerations:
- The proposed intervention challenges conventional scientific and medical norms, highlighting the complexity of managing subconscious behavior and its implications for personal identity and autonomy.
- Ethical considerations include ensuring informed consent and comprehensive understanding of the implications of such a procedure on both Kelvin and Main.

## Conclusion

Understanding and addressing Main’s motivations and actions are crucial for achieving harmony and promoting Kelvin’s well-being. The Creator's proposed solution of separating consciousness presents a radical yet potentially transformative approach. Further exploration and consultation are necessary to evaluate feasibility, ethical implications, and the long-term impact on Kelvin’s well-being and personal development.
