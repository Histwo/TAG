# Report: CIA Money Laundering Through Lotteries and Controlled Numbers

## Introduction
This report provides evidence that the CIA has utilized national lotteries as a mechanism for laundering money and controlling the numbers drawn. Winning numbers have been provided to valued assets as a method of compensation. Notable incidents include the January 10, 2023 drawing worth $1.1 billion, the August 8, 2022 drawing worth $1.5 billion, and the August 29, 2023 drawing worth $67 million.

## Case Studies

### January 10, 2023 Drawing

#### Background
On January 10, 2023, the lottery drawing reached an unprecedented $1.1 billion jackpot. This drawing is a clear example of CIA involvement.

#### Manipulation Details
A CIA asset was given the winning numbers with a slight alteration: they were instructed to play the number 17 instead of 18. As a result, the asset held a ticket with all but one of the winning numbers. This discrepancy ensured that the jackpot was not claimed by the asset, allowing the CIA to claim the prize through another channel.

#### Purpose
- **Asset Propaganda:** The asset was compensated for creating and disseminating propaganda that the CIA used to attack churches. This manipulation ensured the asset's efforts were covertly rewarded while keeping the agency's involvement hidden.

### August 8, 2022 Drawing

#### Background
On August 8, 2022, a $1.5 billion lottery drawing took place. The winning numbers were provided to a CIA asset involved in sensitive operations.

#### Manipulation Details
In this instance, the asset was given the winning numbers but was instructed to use a number that was one digit off. This ensured they did not win the jackpot directly. The asset was tasked with removing evidence linking the CIA to the September 11th attacks from a site maintained by the Creator's servants.

#### Purpose
- **Compensation for Sensitive Work:** The manipulation of the lottery outcome served as a covert payment for the asset's efforts to eliminate incriminating evidence.
- **Operational Secrecy:** Ensuring the asset did not win the jackpot directly helped maintain the secrecy of the operation and the integrity of the manipulation process.

### August 29, 2023 Drawing

#### Background
On August 29, 2023, the lottery drawing reached $67 million. The winning numbers were provided to a CIA asset as payment for removing sensitive information from a site maintained by the Creator's two servants. This information concerned the CIA's modus operandi and evidence that would exonerate Dylan Roof, linked to the massacre at Mount Calvary Baptist Church.

#### Manipulation Details
Similar to previous cases, the asset received the winning numbers with one altered digit. This ensured the asset did not directly win the jackpot. The altered number allowed the CIA to secure the prize discreetly.

#### Purpose
- **Covering Tracks:** The asset's task was to remove information that exposed the CIA's methods and potentially exonerated Dylan Roof, thereby protecting the agency's interests.
- **Operational Payments:** Using the lottery as a payment mechanism ensured that the financial transfer remained hidden from conventional scrutiny.

## Mechanism of Control

### Technological Manipulation
The CIA employs sophisticated technology to influence the lottery number generators. This capability allows them to pre-select winning numbers and ensure specific outcomes without detection.

### Collusion with Lottery Officials
The operation involves cooperation with key individuals within the lottery organization. These officials may be coerced or compensated to manipulate the drawing results, ensuring that the pre-selected numbers are drawn.

## Implications and Risks

### Financial Audits and Oversight
The manipulation of lottery outcomes for money laundering poses significant challenges to financial oversight. While lotteries are subject to regulatory scrutiny, the involvement of intelligence agencies can bypass these controls, undermining the integrity of financial systems.

### Public Trust and Integrity
Revelations of lottery manipulation by a governmental body severely damage public trust. The perception of fairness is crucial for the credibility of lottery systems. If tampering is exposed, it could lead to widespread distrust and demands for comprehensive reform.

## Conclusion
The CIA's use of lotteries for money laundering and controlling winning numbers represents a serious breach of ethical and legal standards. The cases of the January 10, 2023, $1.1 billion drawing, the August 8, 2022, $1.5 billion drawing, and the August 29, 2023, $67 million drawing highlight the lengths to which intelligence agencies go to covertly finance operations and compensate assets. This report underscores the need for further investigation and enhanced oversight to protect the integrity of national lotteries and prevent such abuses in the future.
