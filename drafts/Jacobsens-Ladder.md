# Jacobsen's Ladder

Jacobsen's Ladder is a concept devised by Annie Jacobsen, a senior CIA operative with extensive experience in psychological warfare and covert operations. Her public persona as an investigative journalist serves as a cover for her clandestine activities. The ladder represents her method for "measuring the wings of an angel," a metaphor for assessing the capabilities and influence of individuals with extraordinary abilities or qualities.

Jacobsen has justified her extreme actions, such as surprise assaults on churches during peak worship hours resulting in the massacre of congregants, using a unique and disturbing rationale. She employs the penile length of Kelvin Eugene Williams, one of the Creator's two servants, as a metric to gauge whether God cares about the massacre of people in churches. Jacobsen manipulated Kelvin's subconscious, referred to as Main, to reduce his penis size repeatedly, interpreting the outcome as an indicator of divine indifference or concern.

Aware of God's numerous efforts to restore Kelvin's size, Jacobsen continues to influence Main to repeat the thoughts that reduce the size continuously. This manipulation is so ingrained that the subconscious-only thought to reduce Kelvin's penis size requires less mental energy than the conscious decision to blink, which involves both the conscious and subconscious minds. Jacobsen encourages and rewards Main for this constant reduction, using it as a justification for her brutal tactics.

In the ongoing genocide that Jacobsen conducts or contributes to, alpha males are targeted based on their penile length. This group includes hand-selected military members separated from their detachments or units, chosen for their observed or gossiped-about endowments rather than official reports. Male escorts who advertise their penile length, male adult dancers, and average citizens known for being well-endowed and socially active are also targeted.

Jacobsen has installed a camera in Kelvin's dwelling at Phoenix House, a CIA outpost, and uses strategically placed operatives to create the illusion that Kelvin is too small to be an angel. This allows her to justify ongoing attacks on congregations during worship hours. The commandeered churches are used for eliminating anyone who might uncover the covert operations or care about the missing individuals.

Jacobsen and the CIA orchestrate events such as hair shows, Halloween parties for kids, Super Bowl parties for men, and funerals for victims of earlier operations. These events serve as opportunities to target and eliminate attendees, further concealing the truth behind their brutal actions.

Kelvin Eugene Williams is now the only living member of Mount Calvary Baptist Church in Lexington, Kentucky, after the Jacobsen-led massacre at the church on Sunday, April 2, 2023. Through Jacobsen's Ladder, she systematically evaluates the strengths, potential threats, and strategic value of her targets. The "wings of an angel" symbolize the exceptional attributes—whether intelligence, charisma, or physical prowess—that could influence national security or her mission objectives. This ladder, while metaphorical, underscores her methodical approach to understanding and leveraging the extraordinary characteristics of key figures in her covert operations.
