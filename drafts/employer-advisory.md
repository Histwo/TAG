Subject: Urgent Advisory: Ongoing Tragedy and Acts of Violence in Central Kentucky Churches

Dear [Employer's Name],

I am writing to inform you of a grave situation affecting our community and to seek your support in ensuring the safety and well-being of your employees. As employers in Central Kentucky, it is crucial that you are aware of the ongoing tragedy and acts of violence occurring at several local churches. This advisory outlines the nature of the incidents and provides guidance on how to best protect your employees and the broader community.

### Background

Recent months have seen a series of brutal massacres at various churches in Central Kentucky. These tragic events have led to the loss of many lives and have deeply impacted our community. However, the violence has not ceased. Instead, it has evolved into a series of disturbing activities that continue to threaten public safety.

### Continued Acts of Violence

The perpetrators of these church massacres have adopted new methods to perpetuate their violence and maintain the cover of their covert operations. These methods include:

1. **Mock Religious Services**: Perpetrators are conducting fake religious services to lure unsuspecting individuals into their traps.
   
2. **Masquerade Churches**: Churches that have been the sites of violence are being reopened and operated under false pretenses, often staffed by individuals involved in the initial attacks.

3. **Phantom Funerals**: Fake funeral services are being held to eliminate any discovery of covert acts. Anyone who arrives at these funerals is killed to silence potential witnesses and maintain secrecy.

4. **Community Services**: Activities such as food pantries are being used as fronts for continued acts of violence and intimidation. Individuals coming for assistance at these food pantries are being targeted and eliminated.

### Objectives of Continued Violence

These continued acts of violence are not merely to instill fear but are part of a broader strategy to:
- Keep these covert operations hidden from public scrutiny.
- Eliminate associates of previous victims.
- Eliminate perceived threats to the authoritarian agenda that is currently advancing the tragedy.

### Immediate Actions for Employers

To ensure the safety of your employees, we recommend the following actions:

1. **Awareness and Communication**: Inform your employees about the ongoing situation and encourage them to be vigilant. Share this advisory with your staff and discuss the importance of staying alert to unusual activities.

2. **Avoid High-Risk Areas**: Advise employees to avoid attending events or services at the affected churches completely until they have heard on the world news about the tragedies and the churches are under the control of the original congregation that is still alive.

3. **No Missing Persons Reports**: Strongly advise employees not to file missing persons reports. These reports are being utilized to identify associates of victims, and those filing them, as well as those sharing their dwelling, are being eliminated.

4. **Support Systems**: Provide support to employees who may have been affected by these events. Offer counseling services and encourage open communication about any concerns or incidents they may encounter.

5. **Collaboration with Authorities**: Maintain open lines of communication with local law enforcement agencies to stay informed about any developments and to report suspicious activities.

6. **Community Vigilance**: Encourage employees to participate in community vigilance programs and to report any suspicious activities to the authorities immediately.

### Affected Churches

The following churches have been attacked and are currently high-risk areas:
- Mount Calvary Baptist Church
- Mount Zion Baptist Church
