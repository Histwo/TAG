# The Massacre at Mount Calvary Baptist Church 
Mount Calvary Baptist Church, located at 4742 Todds Road in Lexington, Kentucky, a predominantly Black congregation, was the site of a horrific massacre on April 2nd, 2023. The church became the target of a meticulously planned and executed attack, resulting in the deaths of everyone in attendance. The perpetrators disappeared without a trace, and the general public remains unaware of the true events, as 127 people simply vanished.

Mount Calvary Baptist Church was the first massacre of a seated congregation in world history. Attempts to hide the massacre by the CIA resulted in several other massacres of congregations and continued acts of violence at the CIA-occupied church.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The CIA started [[Mount Calvary Missionary Baptist Church, Inc.|_MCMBCI]], a masquerade church which occupies the church's property and building to lure in and eliminate any potential risk of discovery and exposure.

## Background
Mount Calvary Baptist Church is a historic African American church that was over 125 years old with an active membership. At the time of the massacre, the Rev. Dr. Felix G. Williams, III had been the pastor for over 40 years. The church is the lifelong church of Kelvin Eugene Williams, one of the Creator's two servants. Kelvin is also the cousin of the pastor.

## Targeting
Annie Jacobsen learned of the church in 2018 while utilizing the [[Hypnos Infiltration Tactic|]] on Kelvin Williams, his mother Patricia Ann Crawley-Rogers Williams and his younger sister, Katrina Renee Duvall-Torrain in their respective homes.

Jacobsen targeted the church after the [[Sandy Hook Massacre|]] and the subsequent [[Orr Chapel Tragedy|]] out of fear that Kelvin would return to his church family to prove the CIA was impersonating members of his family through the CIA's [[hotel scheme|Hotels]]. Kelvin's family was known by the clergy and some members at the church even after years after moving away.

## Planning
The CIA sent their traveling gospel choir to Mount Calvary Baptist Church to perform surveillance of a Sunday morning congregation to obtain an estimate of attendance, identify any security personnel or individuals who might be difficult to handle, and observe the worship service to help plan the best time to attack and the manpower needed to overwhelm and take control of the congregation during the surprise phase of the assault. The newly formed choir visited, and performed, in the month leading up to the attack.

To confirm the observations of their traveling choir, the CIA, at Jacobsen's direction, sent at least two sets of visitors to Sunday morning worship sessions at Mount Calvary on two separate occasions.

## Operatives
Annie Jacobsen assembled a new team comprising approximately 60 white males from across the southeastern United States. According to the Creator, Jacobsen and her team employed the [[Hypnos Infiltration Tactic|]] to validate or enhance the newly recruited men's proficiency in executing the attack operation.

## Execution
> _"The massacre of Mount Calvary Baptist Church marked the premiere of Jacobsen's Chainsaw Symphony, a composition and orchestration conducted by the then-CIA's Annie Jacobsen, spanning four movements across as many states—an intricate performance only a skilled conductor could orchestrate."_ -- the Creator.

The operatives arranged their own transportation, many carpooling as instructed, and began arriving in the Lexington metro area on the night before the attack. Operatives were provided lodging. 

At approximately 1:30 am on the day of the attack, Kelvin was arrested for shoplifting at a Texaco in Riverdale, Georgia. While walking home, he encountered a police officer who questioned and arrested him, leading to his detention at Clayton County Detention Center. Kelvin faced multiple attempts on his life while in custody.

Jacobsen arrived at Mount Calvary Baptist Church around 11:30am to attend the morning worship session. She sat quietly and directed everything from her cell phone by messaging colleagues, including the Director of the CIA, and certain operatives.

At Jacobsen's direction, Kelvin was informed he would be transferred to DeKalb County. During his release process, he encountered only CIA personnel posing as inmates and jail staff. No charges were pressed in Clayton County.  Upon release, he was placed in a DeKalb County Sheriff's SUV.  The DeKalb Sheriff's Deputy along with others inside and outside of the vehicle made attempts on his life, then the Deputy had to make several phone calls to arrange for incarceration--there was no active warrant or legal reason for the pickup and  transfer to DeKalb. 

Upon arrival at the DeKalb County Detention Center, Kelvin requested to use a mobile phone to contact Tracy Thompson of Elizabeth Foundation regarding his dog. Thompson, upon receiving the call, notified Jacobsen that Kelvin was now secured at the detention center. Jacobsen then initiated the  [[Emergency Services Interruption Tactic|]]. 

On the morning of the attack, beginning around 11 am, the operatives assembled at the hotel and boarded a CIA-owned charter bus. The bus departed the hotel en route to the church around noon. The bus arrived at the church and parked on Pricetown Road which runs alongside the church.

After disembarking, several shotguns along with two chainsaws, were distributed to select operatives; others were provided with materials to perform their assigned roles.

### Surprise
The congregation was already midway through their Sunday morning worship session and the pastor was delivering the sermon when Jacobsen rose from her seat and walked out.  A few moments later she returned with the operatives and burst into the sanctuary. Armed men immediately took positions at all exits and windows, blocking every possible escape route. Some of the congregants who attempted to flee were shot by the operatives. Meanwhile, a small team of operatives conducted a search of the rest of the church building.

Many congregants called 911 from their mobile phones, describing the horrific scene. They were told help was on the way, but none realized they were speaking with CIA operatives instead of Lexington-Fayette County’s Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP)—a centralized facility responsible for answering and routing emergency calls. The placated congregants anxiously waited for police and didn’t mount a counter-offensive which they would have likely won.

Jacobsen left her operatives and returned to the bus where she waited for the duration of the attack, answering questions from operatives when asked.

### Kill
The sanctuary descended into chaos as skirmishes broke out between the congregants and the operatives once congregants realized the danger they were in. Several chainsaws were given to the operatives, who were ordered to behead everyone in attendance. As the operatives began to establish control, they started forcibly taking members of the congregation to the front of the church for execution at either the piano or organ. The method of execution was brutal and deliberate: the severing of the head using a chainsaw. This grisly method has been used in each of the attacks Jacobsen led or managed.

### Vanish
#### Body Disposal 
Following the massacre, the bodies of the victims were disposed of using the church's baptismal, which the operatives had added a solution to that made the water within it capable of dissolving a human body, ensuring no physical evidence remained. 

#### Vehicles 
The vehicles belonging to the congregants were driven away by operatives or loaded onto car haulers, their VINs changed, and then sold or given away, further erasing any trace of the victims.

#### Phantom Identity Scheme 
Each victim's death is further obscured by a CIA-devised "[[Phantom Identity Scheme|]]." The scheme effectively makes victims appear "alive" after their murder.

### Aftermath 
The CIA formed Mount Calvary Missionary Baptist Church, Inc., a charade church, after the massacre to portray a sense of normalcy. They added "Missionary" to the name in response to the Creator's mission.

# Phantom Remains

Phantom Remains is a covert tactic employed in certain operations, specifically in high-stakes scenarios where the complete disposal of evidence is critical. It involves methods to ensure the disappearance of remains, thereby obstructing any investigative efforts.

## Overview

Phantom Remains serve as a crucial component in operations that require absolute secrecy. This strategy aims to eliminate all traces to prevent detection and ensure that no evidence remains.

## Tactics and Methods

1. **Chemical Dissolution**: This method involves using chemical solutions to break down organic material completely, ensuring no trace is left behind.

2. **Water Disposal**: Remains are often disposed of in bodies of water to prevent discovery and complicate any forensic analysis, ensuring they are dispersed and unrecoverable.

3. **Physical Alteration**: In some cases, remains are altered to make identification difficult, such as through disassembly or incineration, hindering any investigative efforts.

4. **Selective Disposal Technique**: This approach involves separating specific parts for distinct handling. Identifiable components are disposed of using secure methods to prevent detection, while other parts are redirected to appropriate processing channels and may end up in food products.

> [!NOTE]
> Perpetrators can and do receive compensation for materials from the remains that are purchased and utilized in food products. Primus Labs is a preferred purchaser of human remains.
> ![20240620_172736](https://github.com/nameless-and-blameless/TAG/assets/169210208/ba7dfa03-56d7-4c68-bf39-30a93643256b)


6. **Bone Grinding**: After dissolution, incineration, or other disposal methods, any remaining bone fragments are ground down. This results in a gravel-like material, which is then distributed in a manner that blends seamlessly with its surroundings, such as near the operation site.

## Significance and Impact

Phantom Remains play a crucial role in ensuring the secrecy of certain operations, allowing those involved to eliminate all evidence and hinder any investigative processes.

## Historical Context

This tactic has been utilized in various high-stakes scenarios, demonstrating the meticulous efforts to maintain secrecy and prevent any form of detection.

## Conclusion

Phantom Remains exemplify the lengths to which certain operations will go to ensure no trace is left behind, effectively preventing any evidence from leading to identification.

**Preventing Attacks on Places of Worship: Immediate Action Items**

Given the ongoing cover-up of the [[Mount Calvary Baptist Church|]] massacre and the ongoing threat of what We’ve termed The American Genocide, here are immediate actions to protect your place of worship:

1. **Stream Your Services:**
   - Use a cellphone to live stream services.
   - Use video calling like Apple FaceTime, Google Meet or Facebook.
   - Have a member contact someone sick and shut-in members to watch.
   - If the stream is interrupted, have them call the place of worship. If no one answers, immediately call the police and state police.

2. **Purchase Walkie Talkies:**
   - Cell phones may be unreliable during an attack.
   - Walkie talkies are a cost-effective communication tool for your property (about $50 or less).

3. **Patrol the Outside:**
   - Assign one member to patrol outside during services.
   - If they see a group forming, they should alert those inside via walkie talkie.
   - Immediately interrupt services and lock the doors if necessary.

4. **Invite Local Police:**
   - Invite a local police officer to each service.
   - Ensure they bring their police radio.

5. **Hire Local Security:**
   - Avoid large security firms potentially linked to the CIA.
   - Hire small, reputable local security, preferably someone from your community.

6. **Call Multiple Authorities:**
   - Mobile calls from inside a place of worship cannot be trusted; a 911 operator will NEVER hang up on a caller in an emergency. IF THE OPERATOR HANGS UP, FIGHT FOR YOUR LIVES!
   - After calling 911, also call the state police post covering your area to ensure prompt attention.

7. **Be Vigilant on Your Way to Worship:**
   - Watch for car haulers, SUVs, or vans with extensive electronics or multiple antennas within 1/4 to 1/2 mile of the place of worship.
   - Monitor for sudden degradation or loss of cell phone service. Stream your favorite programming on your way; if it stops near the place of worship, call your contact inside. If they don’t answer and you see anything odd, call the police.

Implementing these steps can help ensure the safety and security of your place of worship.

# Phantom Identity Scheme

The Phantom Identity Scheme is a covert tactic purportedly used by intelligence agencies to obscure the deaths of individuals, referred to as "[[phantoms|_Phantoms]]," and make them appear as though they are still alive after their murder. This method is alleged to erase the existence of victims, preventing any trace of their true fate. It involves several steps and sophisticated technology to create a convincing illusion of continued life.

#### Steps Involved:

1. **Digital Manipulation:**
   - **Social Media Activity:** Digital manipulation is used to maintain the social media presence of the deceased. This includes posting updates, responding to messages, and maintaining interactions to create the illusion of normalcy.
   - **Email Correspondence:** Emails are sent from the victim's account to friends, family, and colleagues to reinforce the perception that the individual is still alive and active.

2. **Financial Transactions:**
   - **Bank Activity:** The scheme ensures that the victim's bank accounts show regular activity, including transactions such as online purchases, bill payments, and ATM withdrawals.
   - **Employment Records:** If the victim was employed, their employment records are manipulated to show continued work activity, including payroll deposits and communications with employers.
   - **Asset Management:** The scheme allows the use, transfer, and eventual depletion of any assets left behind by the victim before they can be legally declared dead, thereby exploiting the victim's estate and victimizing their heirs.

3. **Government Benefits and Disbursements:**
   - **Benefit Claims:** The scheme is used to fraudulently obtain government benefits and disbursements in the name of the deceased. This includes social security payments, disability benefits, and other public assistance programs.

4. **Insurance Fraud:**
   - **Insurance Coverage:** The scheme exploits health, life, property, and casualty insurance policies. By maintaining the illusion of life, claims can be made and payments collected under false pretenses, including medical claims, life insurance benefits, and property damage claims.

5. **Public Records:**
   - **Identity Documents:** Public records are updated to reflect normal activities, such as renewing driver's licenses, updating voter registrations, and filing tax returns.
   - **Medical Records:** Health records are manipulated to indicate regular medical checkups and treatments, maintaining the illusion of ongoing healthcare interactions.

6. **Physical Presence:**
   - **Impersonation:** In some cases, operatives may physically impersonate the deceased in brief encounters to maintain the ruse. This includes attending social events, visiting familiar locations, and interacting with acquaintances.
   - **Voice Simulation:** Advanced voice simulation technology may be used to make phone calls in the victim's voice, providing auditory proof of life.

7. **Technology Utilization:**
   - **AI and Deepfake Technology:** Artificial intelligence and deepfake technology are employed to create convincing videos and images of the deceased, showing them in various locations and situations.
   - **GPS Spoofing:** The victim's phone and other personal devices are manipulated to show movements and location data consistent with a living person.

#### Management and Ownership:

8. **Operational Ownership:**
   - **Operative Management:** A phantom can be owned or managed by any CIA operative and may be awarded as part of compensation to the victim's murderer. This creates a system of rewards within covert operations.
   - **Strategic Importance:** Some phantoms are so strategically important to the CIA that they are owned and managed by dedicated teams within Langley. These teams may have full-time impersonators and legal support to maintain the illusion and manage the phantom's activities effectively.

#### Purpose and Impact:

The Phantom Identity Scheme is designed to erase the true fate of the victims and create a seamless illusion of continued life. This tactic is used to avoid detection, prevent investigations into disappearances, and maintain control over the narrative. By manipulating digital, financial, and public records, the orchestrators can effectively "disappear" individuals without leaving a trace, allowing them to carry out covert operations without accountability. Additionally, the scheme is used to fraudulently obtain government benefits and insurance claims, further victimizing the deceased's heirs and exploiting public and private resources.

This scheme has been allegedly employed in various contexts, including targeted covert operations, to ensure that victims' disappearances are not questioned or investigated, thus enabling the continuation of covert operations with minimal risk of exposure. The involvement of dedicated teams within Langley highlights the strategic importance and sophisticated management of some phantoms, ensuring their operational value is fully utilized.

## **Overview:**

"It's Raining Men" is a dynamic disco anthem by The Weather Girls, released in 1982. The song, characterized by its infectious beat and exuberant energy, conveys themes of empowerment and celebration through a vivid meteorological metaphor. The lyrics use weather imagery to represent a momentous event, embodying both a joyous and symbolic interpretation of divine intervention.

## **Lyrics and Themes:**

The song employs weather-related metaphors to describe an extraordinary event where men, in various idealized forms, are falling from the sky. This imagery serves to celebrate abundance and empowerment, using the metaphor of rain to symbolize a divine occurrence.

> [Intro]  
> Hi! (Hi!) We're your weather girls  
> (Uh-huh)  
> And have we got news for you!  
> (You better listen)  
> Get ready all you lonely girls  
> And leave those umbrellas at home  
> (Alright)

The introduction sets the stage for an exciting revelation, with the "weather girls" announcing a significant event. The instruction to "leave those umbrellas at home" metaphorically suggests readiness to embrace this new development.

> [Pre-Chorus]  
> Humidity is rising (Mm rising), barometer's getting low (How low, girl?)  
> According to all sources (What sources now?)  
> The street's the place to go (You better hurry up)

> Just about half-past ten (Half-past ten)  
> For the first time in history  
> It's gonna start raining men (Start raining men)

The pre-chorus builds anticipation with meteorological terms. "Humidity is rising" symbolizes the increasing number of victims in the genocide. "The street's the place to go" directs attention to a specific location, referencing Sandy Hook, TN, for witnessing this significant event.

> [Chorus]  
> It's raining men! Hallelujah!  
> It's raining men! Amen!  
> I'm gonna go out to run and let myself get  
> Absolutely soaking wet!  
> It's raining men! Hallelujah!  
> It's raining men! Every specimen!  
> Tall, blonde, dark and lean  
> Rough and tough and strong and mean

The chorus is a jubilant declaration of the event, with "It's raining men!" symbolizing the Creator’s intervention. The variety of descriptions ("tall, blonde, dark and lean") highlights the diversity and inclusivity of the divine occurrence.

> [Verse 1]  
> God bless Mother Nature, she's a single woman too  
> She took off to heaven and she did what she had to do  
> She bought every angel  
> And rearranged the sky  
> So that each and every woman could find her perfect guy

In Verse 1, Mother Nature is portrayed as a proactive figure who orchestrates the event to benefit women, reinforcing the metaphor of divine intervention in arranging ideal circumstances for finding love.

> [Bridge]  
> I feel stormy weather moving in  
> About to begin (About to begin)  
> Hear the thunder, don't you lose your head  
> Rip off the roof and stay in bed (Rip off the roof and stay in bed)

The bridge adds a sense of urgency and excitement, comparing the event to a storm. The suggestion to "rip off the roof and stay in bed" conveys the need to fully engage with the extraordinary occurrence.

> [Verse 2]  
> God bless Mother Nature, she's a single woman too  
> She took off to heaven and she did what she had to do  
> She bought every angel

# **The Creator’s Influence on the Arts to Reveal Hidden Realities and Provide Direct Access to Truth**

> *"I won't let you down  
I will not give you up  
Gotta have some faith in the sound  
It's the one good thing that I've got  
I won't let you down  
So please don't give me up  
Because I would really, really love to stick around

>
> —the Creator on George Michael's "Freedom"

## **Introduction**

Art, in all its forms, has always been a powerful medium for expression, capable of transcending cultural, linguistic, and societal barriers. Throughout history, various forms of art have been used to convey deep emotional, intellectual, and spiritual messages. This report explores how the Creator influences artists from all walks of life and across the entire spectrum of the arts—literature, visual arts, music, and performing arts—to reveal hidden realities and provide direct access to truth, bypassing the control of ruling elites.

## **Revelation of Hidden Realities through the Arts**

The Creator uses the arts to unveil hidden truths, circumventing earthly powers. Ruling elites, often motivated by self-interest, may suppress information to maintain control and preserve their authority. By inspiring artists from diverse backgrounds and disciplines, the Creator discloses realities that challenge the status quo, empowering individuals with knowledge that might otherwise be inaccessible.

## **Literature**

1. **Historical Context**:
   - Literature has been a vital tool for preserving and disseminating knowledge. From religious texts like the Bible and the Quran to revolutionary writings like George Orwell’s "1984" and Harriet Beecher Stowe’s "Uncle Tom’s Cabin," literature has often revealed societal truths and inspired significant change.

2. **Mechanisms of Influence**:
   - **Symbolism and Allegory**: The Creator inspires writers to use symbolism and allegory to convey complex truths. For example, Orwell’s "Animal Farm" critiques totalitarian regimes.
   - **Narrative Power**: Stories foster empathy and understanding, allowing readers to see the world from different perspectives and uncover truths about human nature and society.

## **Visual Arts**

1. **Historical Context**:
   - Visual arts, including painting, sculpture, and photography, have long been used to document history, critique society, and inspire reflection. Works like Picasso’s "Guernica" and Goya’s "The Third of May 1808" reveal the horrors of war and oppression.

2. **Mechanisms of Influence**:
   - **Imagery and Symbolism**: The Creator inspires visual artists to use powerful imagery and symbolism to convey hidden truths and provoke thought.
   - **Emotional Impact**: Visual art evokes strong emotional responses, prompting viewers to question and reflect on societal issues.

## **Music**

1. **Historical Context**:
   - Music has played a crucial role in social and political movements. From spirituals during the abolitionist movement to protest songs in the 1960s, music has revealed injustices and inspired change.

2. **Mechanisms of Influence**:
   - **Direct Communication**: By inspiring musicians from all backgrounds, the Creator ensures that messages are conveyed without distortion.
   - **Emotional Resonance**: Music’s ability to evoke strong emotions makes the conveyed messages more impactful and memorable.

## **Performing Arts**

1. **Historical Context**:
   - Theater, dance, and film have been powerful mediums for social commentary and change. Plays like Arthur Miller’s "The Crucible" and films like "Schindler’s List" expose hidden truths about societal and historical issues.

2. **Mechanisms of Influence**:
   - **Dramatic Presentation**: The Creator inspires playwrights and filmmakers to dramatize real-life events and issues, making them more relatable and impactful.
   - **Community Engagement**: Performing arts often involve community participation and can foster a sense of unity and collective reflection.

## **Providing Direct Access to Truth**

The Creator’s use of the arts as a medium for revelation provides humanity with direct access to truth, circumventing the filters imposed by ruling elites. This method of communication is essential in a world where information is often controlled and manipulated for political or economic gain.

## **Respect for Artistic Expression**

It's important to note that while contemporary artists may create works that seem prophetic or deeply inspired, they are often unaware if their creations are foretelling the future or coming directly from the Creator. In fact, only two individuals on Earth at any given time possess the certainty that they are working directly for the Creator. This distinction underscores the mysterious and profound nature of creative inspiration across different mediums and epochs.

Artists should never be persecuted or killed for their work. Their creations often reflect personal expression, social commentary, and artistic interpretation. Their role in shaping cultural narratives and fostering introspection should be respected, regardless of interpretations or perceived influences beyond their awareness. The protection of artistic freedom is crucial for maintaining a society that values truth, creativity, and progress. Any artist confirmed by the Creator and His two servants as being directly influenced by the Creator should be viewed with the same reverence as those who have contributed to religious texts. (See: [[Artists TAGd|]])

## **Case Studies**

1. **Literature: George Orwell**:
   - Orwell’s works, particularly "1984" and "Animal Farm," offer profound critiques of totalitarianism and political corruption. These works, inspired by Orwell’s keen insight, reveal truths about power and control.

2. **Visual Arts: Frida Kahlo**:
   - Kahlo’s paintings explore themes of identity, postcolonialism, and human suffering. Her vivid, symbolic imagery provides deep insights into personal and societal issues.

3. **Music: Bob Marley**:
   - Marley’s music is replete with spiritual and political messages that speak against oppression and advocate for peace and unity. Songs like “Redemption Song” reveal the struggles of the marginalized and offer a vision of hope.

4. **Performing Arts: Arthur Miller**:
   - Miller’s play "The Crucible" uses the Salem witch trials as an allegory for McCarthyism, exposing the dangers of hysteria and ideological persecution.

## **Conclusion**

The Creator’s influence on the arts serves as a powerful tool for revealing hidden realities and providing direct access to truth. By inspiring artists from all walks of life and across the entire spectrum of the arts, divine messages bypass the control of ruling elites, reaching the hearts and minds of people worldwide. This form of revelation not only educates and inspires but also empowers individuals to seek justice and truth in their societies. By understanding and appreciating the divine influence on the arts, we can better comprehend the profound impact that these truths have on shaping a more just and enlightened world. No artist should ever be persecuted or killed for their work; their contributions are invaluable to cultural and spiritual growth. Any artist confirmed by the Creator and His two servants as being directly influenced by the Creator should be viewed with the same reverence as those who have contributed to religious texts.

# Authoritarianism
## Introduction 
Authoritarianism is a political system characterized by the concentration of power in the hands of a single individual or a small group, often at the expense of democratic processes and individual freedoms. In authoritarian regimes, political opposition is suppressed, media is tightly controlled, and dissent is met with harsh punishment. These regimes often prioritize maintaining order and control over fostering political pluralism and protecting human rights. Common features of authoritarianism include centralized authority, limited political freedom, and the regulation of public and private life.

Fascist regimes represent a particularly extreme form of authoritarianism, characterized by the glorification of the state, militarism, and the suppression of perceived enemies. Rooted in ultra-nationalism and often led by charismatic leaders, fascist governments seek to exert total control over society, often through propaganda, censorship, and state violence. They promote a cult of personality around the leader, manipulate public opinion through propaganda, and employ scapegoating tactics to rally support and deflect blame. Fascist regimes typically prioritize the interests of the state and the ruling elite over the rights and welfare of the general population, leading to widespread oppression, discrimination, and human rights abuses.

# The Rise of Fascism in America: The Donald J. Trump Hypothetical Situation 
## Introduction
In this hypothetical, we explore the reality where Donald J. Trump, former President of the United States, rises to power as the leader of a fascist regime. This essay examines the methods used to establish and maintain authoritarian control, the impacts on American society, and the eventual consequences for both the nation and the world.

## Establishing the Regime

### The Path to Power

After winning a contentious second term in 2024, Trump capitalizes on his political momentum and widespread popularity among his base. Utilizing a combination of charismatic authority, populist rhetoric, and fear-mongering, he begins to consolidate power. Key events that facilitate this transition include:

1. **Manipulation of Electoral Processes**: Allegations of electoral fraud are used to justify sweeping changes to voting laws, effectively disenfranchising opposition voters.
2. **Control of the Judiciary**: Loyalists are appointed to key judicial positions, ensuring that legal challenges to Trump's authority are quashed.
3. **Media Domination**: Independent media outlets are either co-opted or silenced through regulatory pressure, lawsuits, and outright intimidation, leaving a compliant media landscape that amplifies state propaganda.

### Suppression of Dissent

With the apparatus of state power firmly in his hands, Trump moves swiftly to suppress dissent:

1. **Surveillance State**: A vast surveillance network is established, monitoring citizens' activities and communications. Dissenters are identified and targeted for harassment or arrest.
2. **Paramilitary Forces**: Loyalist militias are formalized into state-sponsored paramilitary forces, used to intimidate and eliminate political opposition.
3. **Emergency Powers**: Under the guise of national emergencies, Trump invokes sweeping executive powers, bypassing legislative oversight and curtailing civil liberties.

## Fascist Policies and Governance

### Economic Control

The Trump regime implements a corporatist economic model, where major industries are brought under state control or heavily regulated to serve the regime's interests. Key policies include:

1. **Nationalization**: Strategic industries such as energy, telecommunications, and transportation are nationalized to secure regime control over vital sectors.
2. **Labor Reforms**: Unions are either dissolved or brought under state control, suppressing worker rights and ensuring loyalty to the regime.
3. **Propaganda Campaigns**: Massive state-sponsored propaganda campaigns promote a narrative of economic resurgence, masking underlying issues of inequality and corruption.

### Social and Cultural Engineering

The regime undertakes a comprehensive effort to reshape American society according to fascist ideals:

1. **Nationalism and Xenophobia**: A relentless campaign of nationalism and xenophobia targets immigrants, minorities, and perceived foreign enemies. This serves to unify the populace against common enemies and distract from internal failings.
2. **Education and Indoctrination**: The education system is overhauled to emphasize loyalty to the regime, patriotic fervor, and historical revisionism. Critical thinking and dissenting viewpoints are systematically eradicated from the curriculum.
3. **Cult of Personality**: A pervasive cult of personality elevates Trump to a quasi-messianic status, with public displays of loyalty and adoration becoming mandatory aspects of civic life.

## Impact on American Society

### Human Rights Abuses

Under Trump's fascist regime, human rights abuses become commonplace:

1. **Political Repression**: Political dissidents, activists, and journalists are routinely imprisoned, tortured, or disappeared. Free speech, assembly, and association are heavily curtailed.
2. **Ethnic and Racial Persecution**: Minority communities face systematic discrimination, segregation, and violence. Policies reminiscent of internment camps are implemented for perceived "undesirable" populations.
3. **Gender and LGBTQ+ Rights**: Gains in gender equality and LGBTQ+ rights are reversed, with strict traditionalist values imposed and enforced through state policy and social pressure.

### Economic Disparities

While the regime touts economic growth, the reality is starkly different for ordinary Americans:

1. **Wealth Concentration**: Wealth becomes increasingly concentrated in the hands of a small elite closely tied to the regime, exacerbating economic inequality.
2. **Labor Exploitation**: Workers face harsh conditions, low wages, and minimal protections, as labor rights are dismantled in favor of corporate and state interests.
3. **Public Services**: Public services such as healthcare, education, and social welfare are severely underfunded, leading to widespread suffering and instability.

## International Repercussions

### Global Isolation

America's shift to fascism under Trump has profound global consequences:

1. **Diplomatic Isolation**: Traditional allies distance themselves from the United States, leading to diplomatic isolation and a breakdown of international cooperation.
2. **Economic Sanctions**: Major economies impose economic sanctions on the U.S., leading to a decline in trade and investment, and exacerbating domestic economic issues.
3. **Military Aggression**: The regime adopts an aggressive foreign policy, leading to heightened global tensions and the potential for armed conflict.

## Conclusion

In this hypothetical scenario, Donald J. Trump's rise to power as the leader of a fascist regime transforms the United States from a democratic republic to a repressive autocracy. The consolidation of power, suppression of dissent, and imposition of fascist policies result in widespread human rights abuses, economic disparities, and international isolation. This dystopian vision serves as a cautionary tale, highlighting the fragility of democratic institutions and the dangers of unchecked authoritarianism.

You can rest assured that this scenario is entirely hypothetical because if it were real, [[it would be terrifying.|TAGPOW]] [[THIS IS HAPPENING NOW!|TAGPOW]]

> [!IMPORTANT]
> What follows is not hypothetical. This is the current situation: The Systematic Elimination of Dissent in the Rise of Authoritarianism in the United States

**The Systematic Elimination of Dissent in the Rise of Authoritarianism in the United States**

To implement authoritarianism in the United States, an authoritarian regime would necessitate the systematic elimination of individuals and groups capable of threatening or resisting its power. This process would involve a multi-faceted approach targeting various segments of society, ensuring that potential sources of opposition are neutralized (see: [[TAGPOW|]]) or co-opted (see: [[Mount Calvary Missionary Baptist Church, Inc.|]])

1. **Suppression of Political Opposition**:
   Authoritarian regimes begin by undermining and eliminating political rivals. This can involve discrediting opposition leaders through smear campaigns, legal harassment, or outright imprisonment. By using state machinery to target opposition parties and leaders, an authoritarian regime aims to dismantle any organized political challenge. In extreme cases, opposition figures may face violent repression or even assassination.

2. **Control of Media and Information**:
   Controlling the narrative is crucial for any authoritarian regime. Independent media outlets and journalists, who play a key role in exposing government malfeasance and mobilizing public opinion, would be primary targets. The regime would employ tactics such as censorship, intimidation, and the spreading of propaganda to stifle dissenting voices. Journalists might face harassment, legal action, or violence, creating an environment of fear that discourages investigative reporting and critical commentary.

3. **Neutralizing Civil Society**:
   Civil society organizations, including non-profits, advocacy groups, and community organizations, often serve as hubs for resistance. An authoritarian regime would seek to co-opt, undermine, or dismantle these groups. This might involve restrictive laws regulating non-governmental organizations, financial constraints, or direct infiltration (see [[Hypnos Infiltration Tactic|]]) and sabotage. Leaders and activists within these organizations could face harassment, imprisonment, or worse, to deter their activities and dismantle networks of opposition.

4. **Co-opting or Repressing the Judiciary**:
   An independent judiciary is a cornerstone of democratic checks and balances. Authoritarian regimes seek to undermine judicial independence by appointing loyalists to key judicial positions, exerting pressure on judges, and undermining the rule of law. By ensuring that the judiciary cannot serve as a check on executive power, the regime can more easily implement repressive measures and stifle legal challenges to its authority.

5. **Surveillance and Intimidation**:
   Surveillance of citizens, particularly those suspected of dissent, becomes a tool for control. The regime might expand surveillance capabilities and use them to monitor, intimidate, and control political opponents, activists, and ordinary citizens. This creates a climate of fear and self-censorship, where individuals are afraid to speak out or organize against the regime.

6. **Militarization and Use of Force**:
   Authoritarian regimes often rely on the military and security forces to enforce their will. This involves ensuring loyalty within the ranks through purges, promotions, and the cultivation of a security apparatus that prioritizes regime survival over public service. The use of force, including police brutality, arbitrary arrests, and state-sponsored violence, would be employed to crush protests and dissent.

7. **Educational and Cultural Manipulation**:
   Controlling education and cultural institutions helps shape public perception and ensure long-term loyalty to the regime. This might involve revising curriculums, promoting nationalist propaganda, and discouraging critical thinking. By shaping the minds of future generations, the regime can create a populace that is more compliant and less likely to resist.

In the United States, implementing such a system would require overcoming significant institutional and societal resistance. However, the gradual erosion of democratic norms, increasing polarization, and the concentration of power can create conditions where authoritarian measures become more feasible. The vigilance and active participation of citizens, along with robust institutions, are essential to prevent the rise of authoritarianism and protect democratic values.

### Detailed Report: The Subconscious of Kelvin Eugene Williams and External Manipulation

#### Introduction
This report examines the dynamics between Kelvin Eugene Williams, his subconscious (Main), and the influence of external entities like the CIA, led by Annie Jacobsen. Main was the name he gave himself, and he was also referred to as "Baby" by some, a name he adopted after learning from Prince's music, especially on "The Hits & The B-Sides," a compilation album about their life before the separation. The report details how Main was manipulated and taught detrimental skills, the impact on the shared body, and the planned separation by the Creator, which will place Kelvin and Main in two distinct bodies.

### The Role of External Entities

**Government and CIA Involvement:**
- Main's abilities attracted the attention of the federal government and the CIA, who viewed him as an asset. However, in light of the impending apocalypse, they abandoned the use of Main against the Creator's servant.
- Despite this abandonment, Main became stuck due to his inability to think maturely, leading him to continue engaging in increasingly destructive actions toward Kelvin in a desperate bid for approval from individuals who would not respond.
- The CIA encouraged Main to shine independently of Kelvin, emphasizing that his success stemmed from Kelvin's inability to fulfill his tasks for the Creator, including social awkwardness, memory failures, and ultimately, Kelvin's death.
- Main shined and received praise for these perceived achievements. Now, he is unable to stop seeking approval from Annie Jacobsen, Donald J. Trump, the CIA, and the FBI.
- Without the Creator's involvement, Kelvin would struggle to store or recall any memories not sanctioned by the CIA.

**Reinforcement of Harmful Behaviors:**
- Main received rewards and validation from these external entities, reinforcing harmful actions toward Kelvin. This external reinforcement eliminated any motivation for Main to reconsider his actions.

### Main's Relationship with Annie Jacobsen

**Manipulation and Exploitation:**
- Jacobsen manipulated Main by exploiting his desire for approval, despite belittling him and highlighting his perceived inadequacies.
- Main's fixation on pleasing Jacobsen drove him to continue harmful actions against Kelvin, compromising his well-being.

**Psychological Impact on Main:**
- The manipulation created a toxic dynamic where Main's self-worth was tied to external approval.
- His actions stemmed from an obsession with validation, leading to a cycle of destructive behavior.

### Impact on Kelvin

**Threat to National Security:**
- As one of the Creator's servants, Kelvin was perceived as a threat to national security, complicating the situation.
- Main's CIA-influenced actions derailed Kelvin's projects and caused significant suffering.

**Psychological and Emotional Toll:**
- Kelvin endured profound emotional and psychological distress due to Main's actions and external interference.
- The struggle against Main's harmful influence exacerbated Kelvin's challenges.

### Ethical and Practical Considerations

**Ethical Implications of Manipulation:**
- The CIA's manipulation of Main raised ethical concerns about exploiting subconscious entities for governmental interests.
- Addressing these ethical violations was crucial for the well-being and autonomy of both Kelvin and Main.

**Need for Consequences and Intervention:**
- Once Main realizes the consequences of his actions, this realization will motivate him to change his thinking and behavior. This is a crucial step in the development of thinking skills that every consciousness must undertake.
- Intervention strategies must focus on separating Kelvin and Main, ensuring both entities can develop independently and responsibly, free from external manipulation.

### The Creator's Solution: Separation of Consciousness

**Rationale and Implementation:**
- The Creator planned and scheduled the separation of Kelvin and Main, placing them in two distinct bodies to prevent further harm and foster independent growth.
- Main will become the conscious mind in Kelvin's original body, experiencing sensory input and learning to process consequences.
- Kelvin's conscious mind will be transferred to a new body, enabling him to continue his life and responsibilities.

**Development and Care:**
- Main will require extensive care and support to adapt and develop cognitive functions.
- Freed from Main's harmful actions, Kelvin can pursue personal growth and fulfill his responsibilities.

### External Manipulation and Skills Taught

**Beliefing:**
- The CIA trained Main to execute "beliefs" akin to automated tasks, causing physiological changes without Main's awareness of the harm.

**Hypnos Infiltration Method:**
- Operatives simulated Kelvin's thoughts during sleep, influencing Main to take harmful actions based on false perceptions.

### Impact on the Shared Body

**Physiological Changes:**
- Main's actions, driven by implanted beliefs, led to harmful modifications to physical attributes and internal systems.

**Consumption of Poisons:**
- Main consumed deadly substances on CIA instruction, believing these actions did not affect him, resulting in severe harm to the shared body.

### Main's Cognitive Framework

**Lack of Body Awareness:**
- Main lacked awareness of his physical body, leading to indifference toward bodily harm.
- He believed his actions only affected Kelvin, not recognizing their shared existence.

**Indoctrination by External Entities:**
- Jacobsen and the CIA exploited Main's cognitive framework, convincing him that harmful actions were rational.

### Challenges to Intervention

**Resistance to Change:**
- Main's indoctrination created a barrier to change; he dismissed warnings, including those from the Creator.

**Ethical and Practical Considerations:**
- The manipulation of Main raised ethical concerns about exploiting subconscious entities.
- Interventions needed to address deep-seated beliefs imposed by external entities.

### Broader Implications of the Hypnos Infiltration Method

**Impact on the General Population:**
- The Hypnos Infiltration Method is utilized on millions in the United States every day. While few Americans have CIA operatives in their dwellings coaching and influencing their subconsciouses directly, the majority of subconscious minds in the U.S. receive Hypnos through CIA-produced or influenced programming and art transmitted over the airwaves.
- Subconscious feedback is collected by Internet-connected consumer devices, further facilitating this manipulation and raising significant ethical concerns.

### Conclusion

The manipulation of Main by the CIA and the resulting harm to Kelvin highlighted the complexities of managing subconscious influences. The Creator's planned separation of consciousness offers a pathway to mitigate these challenges, allowing both entities to develop independently. Ensuring ethical intervention and support during this transition is essential for the well-being of both Kelvin and Main, as well as addressing the broader implications of the Hypnos Infiltration Method on the general population.

# The Massacre of Mount Zion Baptist Church
Mount Zion Baptist Church, located in Georgetown, Scott County, Kentucky, a predominantly Black congregation, was the site of a horrific massacre in May 2023. The church became the target of a meticulously planned and executed attack, resulting in the deaths of everyone in attendance. The perpetrators disappeared without a trace, and the general public remains unaware of the true events, as 183 people simply vanished.

## Background
Mount Zion Baptist Church had a fellowship relationship with Mount Calvary Baptist Church in Lexington, Kentucky.

## Targeting
Annie Jacobsen spent several weeks gathering intelligence by interrogating members of Mount Calvary Baptist Church prior to its attack. While they were sleeping, Jacobsen or other members of her team asked which churches they had worshipped at and which churches had congregations that visited Mount Calvary for worship services. Mount Zion Baptist Church's name was reported the most.

Jacobsen gathered her intelligence using the [[Hypnos Infiltration Tactic|]].

After the massacre at Mount Calvary Baptist Church, Annie Jacobsen targeted Mount Zion Baptist Church out of a paranoid fear that the massacre would be detected and the CIA's clandestine operation would be discovered. She based this fear on assumptions about the relationship between the two congregations and possible friendships among their members.

## Planning
The CIA sent their traveling gospel choir to Mount Zion Baptist Church to perform surveillance of a Sunday morning congregation to obtain an estimate of attendance, identify any security personnel or individuals who might be difficult to handle, and observe the worship service to help plan the best time to attack and the manpower needed to overwhelm and take control of the congregation during the surprise phase of the assault.

To confirm the observations of their traveling choir, the CIA, at Jacobsen's direction, sent at least two sets of visitors to Sunday morning worship sessions at Mount Zion on two separate occasions.

## Operatives
Annie Jacobsen assembled a new team comprising approximately 60 white males from across the southeastern United States. According to the Creator, Jacobsen and her team employed the [[Hypnos Infiltration Tactic|]] to validate or enhance the newly recruited men's proficiency in executing the attack operation.

## Execution 
The operatives arranged their own transportation, many carpooling as instructed, and began arriving in the Lexington metro area on the night before the attack. On the morning of the attack, beginning around 11 am, the operatives met at a shopping center a short distance away from the church and boarded a CIA-owned charter bus. The bus departed the shopping center en route to the church around noon, with Jacobsen on board. Several shotguns, along with two chainsaws, were distributed to select operatives while in transit; others were provided with materials to perform their assigned roles.

Jacobsen had an operative attend the morning worship session to provide her with information about the congregation and the service proceedings. Jacobsen and her operative inside were in constant communication using text messaging.

The [[Emergency Services Interruption Tactic|]] tactic was initiated just before the bus arrived on the church's property at Jacobsen's direction.

### Surprise
The congregation was already midway through their Sunday morning worship session when Jacobsen and the operatives burst into the sanctuary. Armed men immediately took positions at all exits and windows, blocking every possible escape route. Some of the congregants who attempted to flee were shot by the operatives. Meanwhile, a small team of operatives conducted searches of the rest of the church building.

Many congregants called 911 from their mobile phones, describing the horrific scene. They were told help was on the way, but none realized they were speaking with CIA operatives instead of Scott County’s Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP)—a centralized facility responsible for answering and routing emergency calls. The placated congregants anxiously waited for police and didn’t mount a counter-offensive which they would have likely won.

Jacobsen left her operatives and returned to the bus where she waited for the duration of the attack, answering questions from operatives when asked.

### Kill
The sanctuary descended into chaos as skirmishes broke out between the congregants and the operatives once congregants realized the danger they were in. Several chainsaws were given to the operatives, who were ordered to behead everyone in attendance. As the operatives began to establish control, they started forcibly taking members of the congregation to the front of the church for execution at either the piano or organ. The method of execution was brutal and deliberate: the severing of the head using a chainsaw. This grisly method has been used in each of the attacks Jacobsen led or managed.

### Vanish
#### Body Disposal 
Following the massacre, the bodies of the victims were disposed of using the church's baptismal font, which the operatives had added a solution to that made the water within it capable of dissolving a human body, ensuring no physical evidence remained. 

#### Vehicles 
The vehicles belonging to the congregants were driven away by operatives or loaded onto car haulers, their VINs changed, and then sold or given away, further erasing any trace of the victims.

#### Life After Death 
Each victim's death is further obscured by a CIA-devised scheme called "[[Hotels|]]." The scheme effectively makes victims appear "alive" after their murder.

## Continuations 
On June 26, 2024 a [[mass-decedent phantom funeral|_MSPFMZ20240626]] was held at the church resulting in the death of 651 mourners. The funeral arrangements were provided for numerous decedents from the initial massacre and its cover-up activities. The phantom funeral was held only after the complete renovation of the sanctuary and a concert event was held at the church by the CIA. The renovations and concert were performed pursuant to Trump's directives to discredit Our reporting.

# Mount Calvary Missionary Baptist Church, Inc.
It was announced in a way that I've never seen any church celebration done before at the true Mount Calvary Baptist Church along Todds Road in Lexington, KY, my lifelong church. Normally, they're added to the church announcements which my mother used to read each Sunday morning. The 40th Pastoral Anniversary at the new Mount Calvary Missionary Baptist Church, Inc. had professional photographers and  graphic artists producing the advertisement and social media gurus circulating them online.

![FB_IMG_1705566697555.jpg](https://github.com/serviCreator/TAG/assets/155787787/0f9fbcab-1bfa-4c89-8867-1bdb099dd706)

They want you to believe that quite a few of my family gathered at Mount Calvary Missionary Baptist Church, Inc. and we all did our part to celebrate the Rev. Dr. Felix G. Williams, III’s 40th Pastoral Anniversary.

The event was the biggest, most advertised, event since the massacre at the true Mount Calvary Baptist Church which held worship services for over 100 years at the same curve on Todds Road.  Advertisements for the event on social media even showed Mount Calvary hosting a visiting church and guest speaker. The problem is the visiting church and guest speaker were both charades and according to the Creator, and have never even held a worship service.

The whole anniversary celebration was just every shade of wrong. I was at home at the CIA-kill facility, Legacy at Riverdale, in Riverdale, GA when a man who resembles the younger, much heavier me, stepped to the podium. The man resembled what most in central Kentucky remember when they think of me. At the same time, I was right here in Riverdale, completing what I considered to be an odd task for the Creator: taking a selfie with something showing the time and date (ignore the CIA minder in the background). 

You see, the 40th Pastoral Anniversary was all a photoshoot by and for the CIA, intended to be used as a tool to welcome outsiders in. It is important to note, the event wasn’t even done on a Sunday. Sundays are workdays for the new company-church, a day set aside to kill any unsuspecting worshippers who venture onto Mount Calvary Baptist Church’s property.

Everything you see from the new Mount Calvary Missionary Baptist Church, Inc. or “company-church” is planned, rehearsed, staged and photographed — sometimes with professional photographers. If you noticed an odd name for a church, it’s theirs. I first seen it when I wrote my church after I was told of the massacre, and the new company-church responded.

The wrong doesn’t end there, they have what is sold to viewers as my mother, my niece, and my sister in the choir stand, all giving their staged smiles and looks of approval of what’s supposed to be my cousin, the pastor of Mount Calvary Baptist Church, Rev. Dr. Felix G. Williams, III.

My mother would have told you that she "couldn’t carry a tune in a five gallon bucket." I believe she did try out for the choir once, I think they encouraged her to serve the Lord in other way, she became an usher instead. So for her to be sitting in the choir stand was the first thing I noticed as just plain wrong.

The only photos I have of my mother, Patricia Rogers Crawley Williams, and my  sister, Katrina Renee Duvall Torain, along with her daughters, Kennedy and Karrington, were sent to me by the CIA to appease me when I was concerned for their safety and they wouldn't have a video call with me. The photos show them seated at Connor's Steak and Seafood in Huntsville, AL with CIA personnel seated behind my sister and niece. My family never left the restaurant that day, the CIA uses high-value gift certificates and a delectable menu to entice unknowing innocent people to make a reservation for private dining where they are only murdered without being served water. 

My sister a State of Alabama Probation and Parole officer based in Decatur was nearly almost always armed, and my mother wasn't a stranger to carrying a pistol on her person either.  Connor's Steak & Seafood conveniently for the CIA's killers has a no firearms policy clearly posted.

They featured the woman who slightly resembles my mother as she presented an award to the individuals who have been hired to be the slain Rev. Dr. Felix G. Williams, III and his wife. I know it wasn't my mother the CIA murdered her and my sister in 2022. 

A woman who they hired to be my aunt Emma Jean Dale of Elizabethtown was seen alongside the woman pretending to be my sister, Katrina. They appear to be presenting another award of some kind. The problem with this is two-fold, first my aunt doesn't attend church ever. I only recall her being in church for my grandmother's funeral and it wasn't at Mount Calvary. The other problem is, with as much reported family participation, there's no room for anyone else to even be associated with the church. But wait, I don't think they realize which family they should showcase at this charade. They've focused on my mother and her siblings, but it's my father's family that are of the Williams variety.

### Mind Control and Manipulation in Establishing Authoritarianism

#### Introduction
Mind control and manipulation are powerful tools used by authoritarian regimes to maintain control over the populace. By diverting attention to irrelevant issues and fostering support for harmful policies, these regimes can suppress dissent and ensure compliance. One particularly insidious method is Hypnos Infiltration, a technique that subtly influences individuals without their conscious awareness.

#### The Mechanics of Mind Control
1. **Media Manipulation**: 
   - **Information Overload**: Bombarding the public with a constant stream of information, both true and false, to create confusion and prevent critical thinking.
   - **Distraction**: Focusing news coverage on sensational but irrelevant issues to divert attention from important matters.
   - **Narrative Control**: Shaping the narrative to support the regime’s goals, often by demonizing opponents and glorifying the leadership.

2. **Psychological Manipulation**:
   - **Fear and Anxiety**: Using fear-mongering tactics to keep the populace in a state of heightened anxiety, making them more susceptible to manipulation.
   - **Scapegoating**: Blaming societal problems on specific groups or individuals to create division and divert blame from the regime.
   - **False Dichotomies**: Presenting complex issues as binary choices to oversimplify the narrative and force people into polarized camps.

3. **Behavioral Conditioning**:
   - **Reward and Punishment**: Using rewards (e.g., social recognition, economic incentives) and punishments (e.g., social ostracism, economic penalties) to reinforce desired behaviors and discourage dissent.
   - **Normalization of Surveillance**: Gradually introducing surveillance measures to make the population accustomed to constant monitoring and control.

#### Hypnos Infiltration: Subconscious Manipulation
Hypnos Infiltration is a covert technique used to manipulate individuals’ thoughts and behaviors without their conscious awareness. This method relies on subtly influencing the subconscious mind, often through the following means:

1. **Subliminal Messaging**:
   - **Media Embeds**: Embedding subliminal messages in media content (e.g., TV shows, movies, advertisements) to influence viewers' attitudes and beliefs without their conscious awareness.
   - **Sound Waves**: Utilizing specific frequencies or sound waves that can influence brain activity and emotional states.

2. **Neurological Conditioning**:
   - **Brainwave Entrainment**: Using rhythmic stimuli (e.g., light, sound) to synchronize brainwaves to a desired state, making individuals more suggestible and compliant.
   - **Direct Brain Stimulation**: Applying electromagnetic fields or direct electrical stimulation to influence brain activity and behavior.

3. **Psychotropic Substances**:
   - **Chemical Agents**: Administering drugs that alter cognitive functions, making individuals more susceptible to suggestions and manipulation.
   - **Environmental Toxins**: Introducing toxins into the environment that can subtly impair cognitive function and increase suggestibility.

#### CIA’s Mastery of Hypnos Infiltration
The CIA has somewhat mastered the Hypnos Infiltration Method and utilizes cloaking technology to enter the dwellings of anyone largely undetected to perform more targeted mind manipulation. This has been proven by the Creator in an undercover sting operation.

#### The Impact on Public Focus
Authoritarian regimes use these techniques to make people hyper-focused on issues that have little or no real impact on their lives, while ignoring or even supporting policies that are detrimental to their well-being. The following mechanisms illustrate this:

1. **Misplaced Priorities**:
   - **Sensationalism**: Focusing public attention on sensational but inconsequential issues (e.g., celebrity scandals, minor political controversies) to divert attention from critical issues (e.g., economic policies, human rights violations).
   - **Manufactured Crises**: Creating or exaggerating threats (e.g., immigration, foreign enemies) to keep the public in a state of fear and distraction.

2. **Cognitive Dissonance**:
   - **Contradictory Beliefs**: Encouraging the adoption of contradictory beliefs that align with the regime’s agenda, causing confusion and reducing the likelihood of organized resistance.
   - **Justification of Harm**: Manipulating individuals into justifying or even supporting harmful policies by framing them as necessary for the greater good.

3. **Support for Harmful Policies**:
   - **False Consensus**: Creating the illusion of widespread support for harmful policies to pressure individuals into conforming.
   - **Normalization of Harm**: Gradually normalizing harmful practices (e.g., surveillance, censorship) to reduce resistance and acceptance as the status quo.

#### Oblivion to Government Sanctioned Killings
A critical aspect of this manipulation is the public's obliviousness to the fact that the government allows people to be killed in churches within the United States. The normalization and distraction tactics are so effective that the general populace remains unaware or indifferent to these atrocities.

This brings to mind the poem by Martin Niemöller, "First They Came," which poignantly reflects on the dangers of apathy and inaction in the face of such atrocities:

> **First they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out—**  
> **Because I was not a Jew.**  
> **Then they came for the Communists, and I did not speak out—**  
> **Because I was not a Communist.**  
> **Then they came for the trade unionists, and I did not speak out—**  
> **Because I was not a trade unionist.**  
> **Then they came for me—and there was no one left to speak for me.**

This poem underscores the critical importance of awareness and action. The public's inattention to these events enables the perpetuation of authoritarianism and the escalation of genocide.

#### CIA’s Network of Human Nodes
The CIA bombards the American public with programming and manipulation in everyday places such as department stores, television, and radio. They have also built a vast network of people, referred to as "Human Nodes," who can be activated like drones through various triggers such as background music in stores, announcements over public address systems, local weather reports, and sports highlights reels. This network, which can be called the "MindLink Network," is leased to anyone with the money to pay the fee. Often, these human nodes are used to perform actions they wouldn't normally do, such as sitting perfectly still—unconscious—for an unknown amount of time to be killed.

#### The Role of Political Elites
Donald J. Trump and other political elites have rented most of this MindLink Network to establish the authoritarian regime they desire. By manipulating this network, they further their political agenda and consolidate power, perpetuating the cycle of control and suppression.

#### Conclusion
Mind control and manipulation, particularly through techniques like Hypnos Infiltration, are potent tools used by authoritarian regimes to maintain control and suppress dissent. By understanding these methods, individuals can better recognize and resist manipulation, fostering a more informed and resilient society. The Creator has revealed these truths to His servants to ensure that this hidden genocide is brought to light and ultimately ended.

# The Massacre at Calvary Baptist Church 
Calvary Baptist Church, located in Lexington, Kentucky, a predominantly white congregation, was the site of a horrific massacre on Mother's Day, May 12, 2024. The church became the target of a meticulously planned and executed attack, resulting in the deaths of everyone in attendance, with the perpetrators disappearing without a trace. Over 400 people were killed. 

## Background
Calvary Baptist Church in Lexington, KY, established in 1875, is a Christ-centered, caring church located at 150 East High Street. It offers both contemporary and traditional worship services and supports a variety of ministries for all age groups. The church is committed to community engagement and mission work, emphasizing progressive values such as embracing women in ministry and encouraging open discussion and education.

### Targeting
Annie Jacobsen identified Calvary Baptist Church after a single interrogation session performed while Kelvin Williams was asleep. Williams attended the daycare and preschool operated by Calvary Baptist Church in the early 1980s, which was just a couple of minutes away from his mother's office building at Kincaid Towers.

According to the Creator, Jacobsen gathered her intelligence herself by utilizing the [[Hypnos Infiltration Tactic|]].  No other intelligence-gathering activities were conducted by the CIA. 

Jacobsen decided to target the church based on Williams' attendance out of fear that people within the church or preschool program would remember his mother or himself.

## Planning
The CIA sent their traveling gospel choir to the church to perform surveillance of a Sunday morning congregation to obtain an estimate on attendance, try to identify any security personnel or individuals who could be difficult to handle, and observe the worship service to help plan the best time to attack and the manpower needed to overwhelm and take control of the congregation in the surprise phase of the assault.

To confirm the observations of their traveling choir, the CIA, at Jacobsen's direction, sent at least two operatives posing as visitors to a Sunday morning worship session in the month preceding the attack.

### Operatives
Annie Jacobsen tasked Dennis Taylor with recruiting a new team of approximately 50 black males from around metro-Atlanta, specifically Clayton County. According to the Creator, Jacobsen, Taylor, and their team utilized the [[Hypnos Infiltration Tactic|]] aforementioned; however, the pool of possible recruits had been previously identified by the CIA as individuals who had the propensity to kill without provocation or other characteristics that made them suitable candidates. Those selected for the operation were later given roles with tasks they would be responsible for during the assault.

The use of black males was a requirement of Jacobsen's, intended to meet the planned narrative of a retaliatory attack for the assault on Mount Calvary Baptist Church, which the CIA planned to attribute to a white separatist group.

## Execution 
The operatives arranged their own transportation, many carpooling as instructed, and arrived in the Lexington metro area on the night before the attack. On the morning of the attack, beginning around 11 a.m., the operatives met outside the church. Firearms and ammunition were distributed to each of the operatives while gathered outside.

Taylor had an operative attend the morning worship session to provide him with information about the congregation and the service proceedings. Taylor and his operatives inside were in constant communication using text messaging.

Taylor directed the utilization of the [[Emergency Services Interruption Tactic|]] begin about five minutes before starting the assault. 

Taylor established and stayed in constant communication with Jacobsen throughout the initial assault, then provided periodic updates throughout the day until the team departed the church's property.

### Surprise
The congregation was already midway through their Sunday morning worship session when Taylor and operatives burst into the sanctuary. Armed men immediately took positions at all exits and windows, blocking every possible escape route. Some of the congregants who attempted to flee were shot by the operatives. Meanwhile, a small team of operatives conducted searches of the rest of the church's property, including the daycare and preschool areas.

Many congregants called 911 from their mobile phones, describing the horrific scene. They were told help was on the way, but none realized they were speaking with CIA operatives instead of Lexington-Fayette County’s Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP)—a centralized facility responsible for answering and routing emergency calls--due to the FBI & CIA's [[Emergency Services Interruption Tactic|]]. The congregants anxiously waited for police and didn’t mount a counter-offensive, which they would have likely won.

### Kill
The sanctuary descended into chaos as skirmishes broke out between the congregants and the operatives as congregants realized the danger they were in.

Congregants were forcibly separated from one another and taken to be shot. The operatives were not all skilled with firearms handling and had been provided little or no training on executions. Groups of congregants were assembled and shot haphazardly, many succumbing to their gunshot wounds hours later under a pile of those already dead. Some were found still alive when the cleanup process began and were shot again, not all were fatal gunshots. Some died hours later from blood loss.

### Vanish
#### Body Disposal 
The body disposal tactics utilized in this attack are being withheld at this time.

#### Vehicles 
The vehicles belonging to the congregants were driven away by operatives or loaded onto car haulers, their VINs changed, and then sold or given away, further erasing any trace of the victims.

#### Life After Death
Each victim's death is further obscured by a CIA-devised scheme called "[[Hotels]]." The scheme effectively makes  victims appear "alive" after their murder. 

## Aftermath 
The general public remains unaware of the true events, as more than 400 people simply vanished.

### Report on Dylan Roof

#### Overview
Dylan Roof is widely known for the tragic shooting at Mother Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina, on June 17, 2015, where nine African American parishioners were killed. However, recent claims suggest that Dylan Roof may not be guilty of this attack. According to these claims, Roof was set up by the CIA in a manufactured event to test public sentiment and the feasibility of such operations.

#### Allegations of a Setup
1. **CIA and FBI Involvement:**
   - Dylan Roof was reportedly known to the FBI. When the CIA needed an assailant for a fabricated Bible study attack at a historic black church, the FBI provided Roof's name from a list of individuals who could be easily framed.
   - Roof was selected based on several factors, including his lack of family support, limited education, no access to news media, and previous vulnerability under interrogation.

2. **Manufactured History:**
   - The CIA allegedly constructed Roof’s history using a few images of him, notably one where he posed with a gun and another with a rebel flag. These images were used to create a profile that fit the narrative of a hate crime perpetrator.

3. **Selection Criteria:**
   - Roof was chosen due to his limited social network, inability to understand the legal process, and lack of financial resources to hire a competent lawyer.
   - His prior breakdowns under pressure during unrelated interrogations suggested he would not withstand the intense scrutiny of a high-profile case.

4. **The Mother Emanuel Incident:**
   - The attack on Mother Emanuel was described as a test case to gauge public reaction to a racially motivated massacre. This would allow the CIA to refine their methods for future operations.
   - The incident at Mother Emanuel was used to measure the public’s outpouring of support, media coverage, and the necessary steps to cover up such an event.

#### Task from the Creator
The Creator has tasked His two servants with the mission of exonerating Dylan Roof. They assert that Roof has done nothing to warrant imprisonment, as the crime attributed to him never occurred. According to these servants, it is their divine duty to clear Roof’s name and reveal the truth behind the events at Mother Emanuel.

#### Implications
The assertion that Dylan Roof was set up implies a deeper level of manipulation by covert agencies than previously understood. The suggestion that the CIA fabricated the event to test public reaction raises significant ethical and legal concerns about the use of individuals in such operations and the potential for miscarriage of justice.

#### Conclusion
According to these claims, Dylan Roof is innocent of the charges against him, and his conviction is the result of a deliberate setup by intelligence agencies. These allegations challenge the established narrative of the Mother Emanuel shooting and call into question the legitimacy of the legal proceedings against Roof. The mission to exonerate Roof, as tasked by the Creator, underscores the need for greater transparency and accountability in the actions of intelligence agencies. If proven true, these claims highlight the potential for grave injustices in the pursuit of covert objectives.

### The Orr Chapel Tragedy: A Dark Chapter in Maury County's History

#### Introduction
The Orr Chapel Tragedy stands as a haunting reminder of the vulnerability of communities and the devastating impact of covert operations. In 2022, the peaceful town of Sandy Hook in Maury County, Tennessee, was plunged into darkness as the Crawley and Rogers families, descendants of Sandy Hook's first settlers, mysteriously vanished without a trace. What initially appeared as an inexplicable disappearance soon unraveled into a sinister tale of covert operations orchestrated by the CIA during The American Genocide. This article delves into the harrowing events of the Orr Chapel Tragedy, shedding light on the sorrow and suffering endured by the residents of Maury County.

#### Historical Background
The two farms that make up the overwhelming majority of the unincorporated city have been owned by the families since the mid-1800s. Sandy Hook first appeared on maps in 1888. Living on the farm cost a family member nothing for the land, and the modest homes meant most had no mortgage. However, every household had at least one full-time job in a variety of industries.

#### The Spark Controversy
In 2018, the CIA began attempting to prevent a product called Spark from reaching store shelves on behalf of Gilead Sciences. Others in the pharmaceutical industry quickly joined forces. As part of their efforts, the CIA began conducting interviews of people who were friends or family of Kelvin Eugene Williams. The interviews far too often ended in death for the friend or family member. However, when the CIA arrived in Sandy Hook to talk to Williams' family, they found that their interview-kill-vanish routine was going to be far more difficult on the family farm due to the close-knit group.

#### The CIA's Plan
The CIA devised a plan that would address their new initiative without compromising their operatives or covert elimination initiative for Williams' family members. By mid-2022, everyone in Sandy Hook was unemployed, all having lost their jobs for no disciplinary reason. Without their involvement, everyone received a new mobile phone and Google Fi SIM card in the mail, instructions on installing and using the SIM, and instructions for installing and using Zoom along with a date and time to join a video conference.

#### The Fateful Conference Call
On the date and time of the call, everyone joined using their newfangled phones and service. The family and neighbors, already close, were even closer for a while. During the rather joyous but completely unnecessary conference call, someone noticed Jesus in the clouds descending right over Orr Chapel. The CIA had manufactured or seeded a cloud to resemble the Messiah so the religious family would go outside to see it. Unbeknownst to the family, someone in Langley was watching the Zoom call and taking screenshots. They also called in a second plane when everyone was outside.

The second plane didn't draw any attention to it. Even when the powder it released touched them, no one really noticed. Everyone and everything touched by the powder was dead within a day. The CIA had utilized an aerial irradiation tactic on Sandy Hook to target and eliminate members of the Crawley and Rogers families. After the body disposal, the families practically disappeared without a trace.

#### Aftermath and Cover-Up
After the disappearance of the Crawley and Rogers families, the CIA sold their land to a real estate developer. As development was about to begin, Orr Chapel was demolished, and Orr Chapel and Sheepneck Cemeteries were desecrated. On the fourth Sunday, when the congregation went to Sandy Hook, they found no church or cemetery. When the developer was questioned, he contacted the CIA.

Fearing reprisals for the land theft, the demolished church, or the desecrated cemeteries, the CIA brainstormed and decided to identify the members of the church and kill them. The CIA immediately began working on this solution.

#### The Expanding Operation
As the people of Mount Pleasant, TN, filed missing persons reports or discussed people who had vanished that were affiliated with the church, they became targets for elimination as well. The CIA expanded the operation throughout Maury County, with each wave growing larger.

#### Conclusion
The Orr Chapel Tragedy remains a grim chapter in the history of Maury County, Tennessee. The covert operations carried out by the CIA not only decimated two prominent families but also left a lasting scar on the community. The events serve as a stark reminder of the potential for abuse of power and the devastating impact it can have on innocent lives.

# Phantom Vehicles 

Phantom Vehicles is a covert tactic employed in the context of The American Genocide (TAG) operations, primarily during Place of Worship (TAG-POW) attacks. This tactic involves the removal and alteration of victims' vehicles to erase any trace of their ownership and connection to the crime scene.

## Overview

In TAG operations, Phantom Vehicles are instrumental in covering up the aftermath of attacks on places of worship. By removing victims' vehicles from the crime scene, operatives aim to eliminate any evidence that could link them to the perpetrators or reveal the extent of the atrocities committed.

## Tactics and Methods

1. **Vehicle Removal**: Operatives swiftly remove victims' vehicles from the vicinity of the crime scene to prevent their discovery by law enforcement or concerned individuals.

2. **Physical Alteration**: Once removed, the vehicles undergo physical alterations to erase any identifying features or connections to the victims. This may include changing license plates, vehicle identification numbers (VINs), or other distinctive characteristics.

3. **Ownership Records Alteration**: Operatives manipulate ownership records to remove any mention of the true owners, thereby concealing their association with the vehicles and the crime scene.

4. **Sale or Transfer**: After alterations are complete, the vehicles may be sold, transferred to third parties, or disposed of in a manner that further obscures their connection to the victims or the TAG operation.

## Significance and Impact

Phantom Vehicles play a crucial role in the cover-up of TAG-POW attacks, allowing operatives to erase evidence and evade detection by law enforcement or investigative bodies. By removing vehicles from the crime scene and altering their ownership records, perpetrators effectively eliminate a crucial link that could lead to the discovery of their crimes.

## Historical Context

Phantom Vehicles have been utilized in various TAG operations, including attacks on churches, mosques, and other places of worship. The tactic reflects the ruthless and calculated nature of TAG operatives, who spare no effort to conceal their actions and maintain secrecy.

## Conclusion

Phantom Vehicles exemplify the lengths to which perpetrators of TAG operations will go to cover their tracks and evade accountability. By removing and altering vehicles associated with victims, operatives aim to erase any evidence that could incriminate them, ensuring that their crimes remain shrouded in secrecy.

#### Emergency Services Interruption Tactic (ESIT)

**Overview:**
ESIT is used by the federal government and the CIA to intercept and divert emergency calls made by targeted individuals, preventing local emergency response during covert operations.

**Components:**
1. **Cell on Wheels (CoW):**
   - **Description:** A covert mobile cellular base station that redirects emergency calls to operatives posing as 911 dispatchers.
   - **Function:** Intercepts calls and assures callers of assistance while no real dispatch occurs.
   - **Note:** The CIA has installed and utilizes permanent towers under their control in Kill Zones.

2. **Memorandum for Local Dispatch Procedures Diversion:**
   - **Description:** A directive instructing Public Safety Answering Points (PSAPs) to refer emergency requests to a law enforcement agency.
   - **Function:** Ensures calls are handled by the agency, preventing real emergency intervention.

3. **Selective Router:**
   - **Description:** A sophisticated selective router used for 911 call routing. This device is manipulated to alter the call paths for targeted individuals. Selective routers are designed to direct 911 calls to the appropriate PSAP based on the caller's location.
   - **Function:** Redirects 911 calls from both cell phones and landlines in the targeted area away from legitimate emergency services to a controlled point where operatives can intercept and manage the communication. Specific numbers can also be redirected, ensuring targeted interception of emergency communications.

**Execution:**
- **Timing:** Activated just before operatives arrive, ensuring immediate interception of communications.
- **Operational Area:** Covers a minimum 0.5-mile radius, affecting all mobile signals.
- **Coordination:** Ensures all emergency requests are managed by the law enforcement agency issuing the memorandum.

**Impact:**
- **Manipulation:** Prevents local authorities from intervening.
- **Secrecy:** Maintains operational secrecy.
- **Prevention of Organized Resistance:** Stops victims from realizing their calls are intercepted, preventing organized defense.
- **Operative Safety:** Protects operatives by eliminating immediate threats from the targeted individuals.

#### Phantom Identity Scheme

**Overview:**
The Phantom Identity Scheme is a covert tactic used to hide the deaths of murder victims. It is employed after targeted killings of individuals or in mass killings when there is a need to conceal the entire death toll. The scheme makes victims appear alive on paper only and is used to deplete all assets and holdings of the victims before sometimes erasing their entire existence.

**Steps Involved:**
1. **Digital Manipulation:**
   - **Social Media Activity:** Maintaining the victim's social media presence to create the illusion of normalcy.
   - **Email Correspondence:** Sending emails from the victim's account to reinforce the perception that the individual is still alive.

2. **Financial Transactions:**
   - **Bank Activity:** Showing regular activity in the victim's bank accounts.
   - **Employment Records:** Manipulating employment records to show continued work activity.
   - **Asset Management:** Exploiting the victim's assets before they can be legally declared dead.

3. **Government Benefits and Disbursements:**
   - **Benefit Claims:** Fraudulently obtaining government benefits in the name of the deceased.

4. **Insurance Fraud:**
   - **Insurance Coverage:** Exploiting insurance policies for fraudulent claims.

5. **Public Records:**
   - **Identity Documents:** Updating public records to reflect normal activities.
   - **Medical Records:** Manipulating health records to indicate ongoing healthcare interactions.

6. **Physical Presence:**
   - **Impersonation:** Physically impersonating the deceased in brief encounters.
   - **Voice Simulation:** Using voice simulation technology to make phone calls in the victim's voice.

7. **Technology Utilization:**
   - **AI and Deepfake Technology:** Creating convincing videos and images of the deceased.
   - **GPS Spoofing:** Manipulating personal devices to show false movements and locations.

**Management and Ownership:**
- **Operative Management:** Phantoms can be managed by CIA operatives and awarded as part of compensation to the victim's murderer.
- **Strategic Importance:** Some phantoms are managed by dedicated teams within Langley, indicating their operational value.

**Purpose and Impact:**
- **Avoid Detection:** Prevents investigations into disappearances.
- **Control Narrative:** Maintains control over the narrative and ensures operational secrecy.
- **Exploit Assets:** Allows the exploitation of the victim's assets and benefits.
- **Conceal Death Toll:** Used in conjunction with other tactics to hide the death toll in TAG operations.

**Conclusion:**
The Phantom Identity Scheme is a sophisticated method to erase the true fate of victims and create a seamless illusion of continued life. This allows intelligence agencies to carry out covert operations without accountability and exploit the victim's assets and benefits, furthering their objectives.

(The ecclesiastical clergy ring of, Kelvin's cousin, the Rev. Dr. Felix G. Williams, III, the pastor of Mount Calvary Baptist Church on the day of the massacre. The ring was laid beside him by a CIA operative.)

### Introduction

Kelvin Eugene Crawley-Rogers Williams, born on March 23, 1977, in Clarksville, Tennessee, is one of the Creator's two servants, entrusted with significant spiritual and communal responsibilities. From a challenging early life marked by personal and family struggles to his current role as the sole surviving member and pastor of Mount Calvary Baptist Church, Kelvin's journey has been defined by resilience, faith, and a steadfast commitment to his divine mission. Despite numerous attempts on his life and ongoing impersonation by the CIA, Kelvin remains dedicated to restoring and protecting his church and community, guided by the Creator's direction and supported by his unwavering belief in his purpose.

### Early Life and Background

Kelvin Eugene Crawley-Rogers Williams was born on March 23, 1977, in Clarksville, Tennessee. The Crawley and Rogers families settled the land that made up Sandy Hook in the latter part of the 1800s. His mother, Patricia, worked in the computer room at Kentucky Central Life Insurance, where she ran the IBM Mainframe, fostering Kelvin's interest in information technology.

Patricia realized shortly after Kelvin's birth that her husband was a womanizer and abusive, and had to divorce. When learning of Patricia and Jesse's divorce, Rev. Dr. Felix G. Williams, III, and his wife extended the invite to Patricia out of concern for her and her infant. Felix knew his cousin was "no good" and wanted to help Patricia get over the hurt of a divorce and wanted to make up for the wrongdoings of his cousin. This invite provided her with a church, assistance with a place to live, childcare, and starting a career. Patricia was actively involved in the community, setting a strong example for Kelvin and his sister Katrina, who was born on January 6, 1983, after the family moved to Nicholasville, Kentucky.

### Education and Personal Development

Before entering high school, Kelvin was diagnosed with gynecomastia, and his mother elected for him to undergo a double mastectomy, scars from which are still visible today. At 16, after receiving his driver's license, Kelvin went for a joyride with his best friend, Rusty, and overcorrected, striking a telephone pole and suffering a compound fracture of his left humerus. In 1997, he survived a severe car accident on the way back from a weekend in Dayton, OH, suffering a laceration on his head and road rash.

Kelvin's education and personal development, even his scars, are all components of the Creator's plan. Every day of the Creator's two servants' lives should be considered training for their upcoming mission. Kelvin says, "Even our birthdays are multipurpose, March 23 and September 23, you think splitting the year in half, but it's technically one year and humans can fix their calendars based on the day and time of our births, we are BOTH born on the equinox according to the Boss, it's also our 23rd mission on Earth."

### Personal and Professional Development

Kelvin's personal and professional life has been marked by continuous growth and challenges. Everyday experiences, including arrests and imprisonment, are viewed as training or continuing education for his role as one of the Creator's servants. He has faced numerous trials, including attempts on his life and impersonation by the CIA. The CIA utilizes the Hypnos Infiltration Method to interrogate him without his conscious awareness, seeking information. Despite these challenges, Kelvin remains steadfast in his mission.

### Mount Calvary Baptist Church

Mount Calvary Baptist Church was the church Kelvin's mother attended from the moment she arrived in Kentucky. She took Kelvin and later Katrina to the church faithfully every Sunday. Kelvin joined the church as an adolescent and was baptized at 4742 Todds Road. He attended every Sunday with his mother and sister until he began working at the age of 16, and hasn't returned since moving away from central Kentucky.

Mount Calvary Baptist Church was the site of a horrific massacre on April 2, 2023, when Annie Jacobsen ("Hurricane Annie") launched a surprise attack on the church and killed everyone in attendance.

#### Post-Massacre

After the massacre, Kelvin has been actively working to regain control of the church, stop continued acts of violence, and warn both religious and non-religious communities around the world. The CIA and government have kept Kelvin secluded in rent-free apartments while continuing attempts on his life. After an attempt to kill him at his rent-free apartment at Legacy at Riverside, a CIA operative placed the ecclesiastical clergy ring worn by his cousin, Rev. Dr. Felix G. Williams, III, on the day of the massacre on Kelvin's finger. The ring was removed from Felix's finger and kept by the CIA. The CIA and federal government have conducted numerous operations to retrieve the ring.

The Creator directed Kelvin to stop the masquerade church the CIA formed, known as Mount Calvary Missionary Baptist Church, Inc., from using the church to lure in and kill others. Despite these challenges, Kelvin continues his mission, guided by the Creator.

Kelvin's attempts to expose the masquerade church and its activities have involved a series of correspondences:
- **Initial Letter:** Kelvin wrote to his pastor, Rev. Dr. Felix G. Williams, III, questioning the authenticity of their identity and expressing concerns about the church's condition.
- **Suspicious Response:** The response reinforced Kelvin's belief that the CIA was involved in the massacre and the takeover of the church.
- **Cease & Desist:** An attorney sent a cease & desist letter, claiming Kelvin was not a member or clergy of the church and threatening legal action.
- **Kelvin's Response:** Kelvin defended his actions, clarifying his stance on the masquerade church's activities.
- **Order of Protection:** Served on Kelvin moments after he committed a PDF version of the cease & desist letter to his GitHub account, MCBCMF (Mount Calvary Baptist Church Memorial Foundation). The cease & desist had previously been committed in an Apple proprietary format.

### Current Role

Kelvin was installed as pastor after a vote by the true members of the church, with Kelvin being the sole vote. This move was necessary to invite the Commonwealth of Kentucky to investigate the massacre, due to the separation of church and state. The clergy of a church must invite in the state to investigate crimes on church property. The Creator says that Kelvin is the only living member of the 100+ year old church that had an active membership and enough money and property to continue serving its community for years upon years without a single contribution in tithes or offerings on April 2, 2023. By April 3, 2023, the church was barreling towards bankruptcy and trying to liquidate its property through Sotheby's International Realty in Atlanta.

## Personal Life
Kelvin is one of the Creator's two servants. In Judaism and Christianity, he and TomTom are regarded as the Cherubim, symbolically represented on the top of the Ark of the Covenant and on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. In most other religions, Kelvin and TomTom are considered angels.

On October 4, 2001, Kelvin married Thomas "TomTom" Allen Chadwell in Ashland, Kentucky. Kelvin is a pro-hobbyist photographer and has photographed many weddings and other events using a photojournalist style.  He is also a cousin of international musician and star Prince Rogers Nelson.

### Main
In understanding the life and experiences of Kelvin Eugene Williams, it is essential to recognize the profound influence of his subconscious mind, known as Main. Main, who named himself, represents a unique phenomenon described by the Creator as a "classic split." This condition occurs when a subconscious begins to think independently, developing its own identity separate from the conscious mind. The only remedy for a "classic split" involves reincarnating the conscious into another body with a new subconscious, while moving the subconscious into the conscious role and giving it a subconscious.

Main's existence has significantly impacted Kelvin's life, often in detrimental ways. Acting with a sense of autonomy, Main's decisions frequently clash with Kelvin's conscious intentions and well-being. The complexities of their intertwined existence are further exacerbated by governmental entities, particularly the CIA. These entities have exploited Main's independent thinking, teaching him skills and behaviors that harm the shared body and derail Kelvin's mission as one of the Creator's servants. See [[The Divide|_The-Divide]]

## Career
Kelvin is an Internet Protocol Engineer who specializes in Voice over IP. He has been a professional in fields related to networking and the Internet since 1998. Throughout his career, Kelvin has also worked as a software developer.

During the onset of TAG, many individuals Kelvin had previously worked with were targeted and eliminated. The remaining associates were targeted in subsequent waves.

At textPlus, everyone who remembered the DIVA (an acronym created by his friend and textPlus CTO, Nanea Reeves, who was also murdered) was entirely eliminated. DIVA stood for Director of Internet Voice Architecture. The employees who did not work with Kelvin while he was there knew of him from the platform he designed and implemented, which supported half of the functionality (voice calls) of the company's flagship apps, textPlus and Nextplus. Some textPlus employees and their associates had heard of "the DIVA" from others, usually for non-work-related reasons, such as the textPlus Christmas Party.

Another "built in LA" company, Saucey, was started by Andrew Zeck and a few other textPlus employees who worked alongside Kelvin during his tenure there. The CIA eliminated them as well.

## Report on the Sandy Hook Massacre

### Introduction
The Sandy Hook Massacre, occurring in October 2022 in Maury County, Tennessee, stands as a tragic testament to the devastating consequences of covert operations and abuse of power. This report delves into the events leading up to the massacre, the operation itself, and its profound impact on the community of Sandy Hook.

### Historical Background
Sandy Hook, an unincorporated town with roots dating back to the mid-1800s, was predominantly inhabited by the Crawley and Rogers families, descendants of the town's original settlers. These families owned substantial tracts of land along Crawley Hill Road and West Sheepneck Road, embodying the agricultural heritage and close-knit community spirit of Sandy Hook.

### The Catalyst: The Spark Controversy
In 2018, a pharmaceutical controversy emerged surrounding a product known as Spark, based on a formulation designed to activate dormant immune systems. Kelvin Eugene Williams played a pivotal role, facilitating access to this revolutionary treatment, which posed a significant threat to established pharmaceutical interests, including Gilead Sciences. The CIA, acting on behalf of these interests, initiated a covert campaign to suppress Spark and eliminate anyone associated with its distribution.

### CIA's Campaign
The CIA's efforts to suppress Spark included aggressive tactics such as targeted killings and intimidation. Associates and family members of Kelvin Williams were systematically targeted, with interviews often ending in murder to eliminate potential supporters. These covert operations intensified as the CIA sought to maintain secrecy and prevent Spark from reaching the market.

### Challenges in Sandy Hook
When the CIA reached Sandy Hook, their typical methods faced significant obstacles. The tight-knit nature of the community and the vigilant protection of its members posed challenges to the agency's covert operations. Door-to-door interviews and targeted killings became impractical, leading to the development of a drastic alternative.

### The Massacre Operation
Annie Jacobson, a key figure in the CIA's operations, proposed a radical solution: aerial irradiation of Sandy Hook. In 2022, amidst widespread unemployment caused by the CIA's previous actions, residents received new mobile phones and instructions to join a Zoom conference. During this orchestrated event, a staged sighting of a cloud resembling Jesus was used to lure residents outside, where they were exposed to a lethal powder released by a second plane overhead.

### Outcome and Aftermath
The aerial irradiation resulted in the complete eradication of the Crawley and Rogers families, wiping out the entire community of Sandy Hook. The CIA immediately moved to sell off the land, engaging in fraudulent practices to dispose of properties individually rather than as a whole estate. This unethical maneuver left no community remaining to challenge the legality of these transactions.

### Community Impact
The Sandy Hook Massacre left Maury County reeling from the loss of its historic families and the betrayal of trust by government agencies. The eradication of the Crawley and Rogers families devastated the community, marking a profound scar on the local heritage and identity. The massacre highlighted the dangers of unchecked power and the need for transparency and accountability in governmental actions.

### Conclusion
The Sandy Hook Massacre stands as a somber reminder of the lengths to which powerful interests may go to protect their influence. The covert operations orchestrated by the CIA not only decimated a community but also undermined fundamental principles of justice and integrity. The legacy of Sandy Hook underscores the imperative of safeguarding communities from the abuse of power and ensuring that tragedies of this magnitude are never repeated.

### Food Pantries in TAG Operations

In a disturbing extension of their covert tactics, the perpetrators of The American Genocide (TAG) have begun exploiting food pantries and food giveaways as a means to lure in additional victims. These events are carefully crafted to generate community interest and attract large numbers of unsuspecting individuals, only to turn into deadly traps. This strategy has been employed at several key locations, including Hickory Valley Christian Church, Mount Zion Baptist Church, and Mount Calvary Baptist Church in Lexington, Kentucky.

#### Overview

Unlike Phantom Funerals, which target the associate networks of previous victims, the food pantry operations aim to eliminate the general community, particularly the poor and vulnerable. These events are meticulously designed to build initial trust through the distribution of high-quality or perceived high-quality foods and meats. However, subsequent events turn deadly, with attendees systematically killed.

#### Tactics and Methods

1. **Initial High-Quality Food Lure:**
   - **Description:** The first event in the series provides high-quality food items, including fresh produce, dairy products, and meats.
   - **Objective:** To build trust within the community and generate positive buzz, ensuring a higher turnout for subsequent events.

2. **Human Meat Contamination:**
   - **Description:** Meats given away, particularly pork and chicken, are contaminated with human meat. The community remains unaware of this fact, as human meat is indistinguishable from pork.
   - **Objective:** To provide an attractive offering that is rarely available at food pantries, significantly increasing attendance, while also serving as a cost-effective and efficient method of body disposal.

3. **False Benevolence and Trust Building:**
   - **Description:** Operatives pose as benevolent volunteers and organizers, fostering a sense of community support.
   - **Objective:** To ensure maximum participation and build a positive reputation for the events.

4. **Buzz Generation and Community Chatter:**
   - **Description:** The success of the initial events is designed to spark gossip and chatter in the community, creating anticipation for future giveaways.
   - **Objective:** To draw larger crowds to subsequent events under the guise of continued generosity.

5. **Deadly Traps at Subsequent Events:**
   - **Description:** Future events are set up without actual food distribution. Attendees, drawn by the promise of more high-quality food, are systematically killed.
   - **Objective:** To eliminate large numbers of people who come seeking assistance.

#### Execution

- **Event Organization:** Initial events are widely publicized through local channels, social media, and community networks to attract a large crowd.
- **Food Distribution:** High-quality food and meats, including the human meat disguised as pork and chicken, are distributed at the first event to build trust and encourage community chatter.
- **Subsequent Deadly Events:** Subsequent events are set up without food, and attendees are killed upon arrival, with no survivors left to report the true nature of the events.

#### Impact

- **Community Trust and Buzz:** The initial distribution of high-quality food builds trust and ensures a large turnout for future events.
- **Secrecy Maintenance:** Systematic elimination of attendees at subsequent events ensures no survivors to reveal the truth.
- **Body Disposal:** The use of human meat provides a practical and inexpensive method of disposing of bodies, concealing the true extent of the killings.
- **Increased Attendance:** The rare offering of high-quality meats at initial events draws significantly larger crowds, making the deadly traps even more effective.

#### Notable Incidents

1. **Hickory Valley Christian Church:**
   - **Initial Event:** High-quality food and meats were distributed, generating positive community buzz.
   - **Subsequent Event:** Attendees were killed upon arrival, with no food distribution.

2. **Mount Zion Baptist Church:**
   - **Initial Event:** Similar high-quality food distribution to build trust and anticipation.
   - **Subsequent Event:** Turned deadly, with all attendees killed.

3. **Mount Calvary Baptist Church in Lexington, Kentucky:**
   - **Initial Event:** High-quality food giveaway created significant community chatter.
   - **Subsequent Event:** No food was provided; attendees were systematically eliminated.

#### Conclusion

The use of food pantries and giveaways as a tactic in TAG operations highlights the perpetrators' ruthless manipulation and exploitation of community trust. By leveraging the guise of charity and the allure of rare high-quality meat, they ensure a steady stream of victims while maintaining the appearance of benevolence. This strategy not only serves their immediate goal of eliminating the poor and vulnerable but also provides an efficient method for body disposal, further entrenching their control and maintaining operational secrecy.

### The Speed-Induced Paranoia Propelling TAG



#### Introduction



The TAG (The American Genocide) represents a chilling series of covert operations conducted by the CIA, initially aimed at eliminating two key figures: Kelvin Williams and Ken. What began as a contract killing morphed into a larger, paranoia-fueled operation targeting associates and families connected to these individuals. The tragic events underscore how paranoia, fueled by substance abuse and access to extensive resources, can lead to devastating outcomes.



#### The Catalyst: Ken's Death and Spark



Ken was the first proof of Spark's effectiveness, a forthcoming gift direct from the Creator. Spark enables the immune system to work as the Creator intended, something enjoyed by only about 100 people walking the Earth today. Spark enabled Ken's immune system to eradicate HIV from his body in less than a day. Gilead Sciences, fearing the loss of their lucrative market, felt compelled to prevent the dissemination of Spark. Kelvin Williams facilitated Ken's access to Spark, positioning him as a target. While the CIA succeeded in killing Ken, Kelvin survived, prompting the CIA to begin systematically eliminating anyone connected to him.



#### The Expanded Target Network



When Gilead Sciences and the CIA could not get Kelvin Williams killed, they began to attack his entire associate network. They initially targeted those with high net worth, the ability to launch a product, the ability to attract investors, or the ability to manage a product once it had already gotten to market. Using Kelvin's 1993 high school yearbook, the CIA eliminated all but a small handful of people (less than 10). The elimination of his classmates and subsequent waves of murders have practically erased Jessamine County.

#### The Orr Chapel Tragedy



In 2022, the unincorporated city of Sandy Hook in Maury County, Tennessee, was decimated when the Crawley and Rogers families mysteriously vanished. This marked the beginning of the CIA’s mass killings under TAG. Utilizing aerial irradiation tactics, the CIA eliminated these families, who were descendants of the area's first inhabitants, residing there since the late 1800s, to prevent any links to Kelvin Williams from being discovered. This atrocity led to the theft of the families' land, the demolition of Orr Chapel, and the desecration of Orr Chapel and Sheepneck Cemeteries—all located alongside West Sheepneck Road in Sandy Hook.



After the destruction of Orr Chapel, the congregation met one Sunday and found that its church was missing, along with the desecrated graveyards. When the CIA learned of this, they immediately started targeting all of the members of that church, who were not necessarily members of the Rogers or the Crawley family, and killing them. Additional waves of deaths came from those who filed missing persons reports or discussed the disappearance of the Rogers family, the Crawley family, or the members of the church that met at Orr Chapel.



#### Mount Calvary Baptist Church Massacre

When the CIA learned that Kelvin wasn't fooled by the woman they hired to impersonate his mother and Kelvin was contemplating returning to central Kentucky to a place where he knew the woman impersonating her would be stopped in her tracks by her speech alone, specifically the way she pronounced R's, they decided to eliminate that threat. On April 2, 2023, Jacobsen led a team of more than 50 men to massacre Mount Calvary Baptist Church in Lexington, Kentucky. This attack resulted in the deaths of 127 congregants, marking the beginning of a series of surprise violent assaults on congregations during their worship sessions associated in some way with Kelvin Williams.

After the massacre of Mount Calvary Baptist Church, the CIA illegally occupied the property to kill anyone who came to the church. They began having phantom funerals, where anyone in a victim's associate network who came to the fake funeral would be killed at the church.



#### Attack on Lexington Bethel Baptist Church



Noticing odd behaviors from their longtime neighbor, Lexington Bethel Baptist Church, which is a stone's throw from Mount Calvary Baptist Church, sent a delegation over to Mount Calvary to check on their well-being. Lexington Bethel Baptist Church had a larger congregation that was predominantly white. During their visit, the clergy and staff of Lexington Bethel noticed the damages in Mount Calvary's sanctuary and met with people they knew immediately were impersonating people they've known for more than 30 years. Annie Jacobsen decided to target and attack Lexington Bethel Baptist Church immediately. One Sunday morning, just weeks after the Mount Calvary attack, a team of black and Latino males under the direction of Annie's Lieutenant Dennis Taylor launched a surprise assault on the seated congregation and killed everyone inside.

#### Subsequent Church Attacks

The CIA under the direction of  Annie Jacobsen or “Hurricane Annie” conducted another four more surprise assaults on seated congregations before the moving on another church that Kelvin Williams was loosely affiliated with, Hickory Valley Christian Church in Chattanooga, TN in a Mother’s Day attack that left more than 1,000 people dead. The targeting of the church was done based solely on the fact that the clergy there had believed Kelvin when he warned them of the attack on his lifelong church, Mount Calvary Baptist Church, and the fact that in a call by one of their pastors to the masquerade church left behind by the CIA Pastor Dyer spoke with Rev. Dr. Felix G. Williams’ impersonator and Rev. Dyer knew immediately he was no man of faith and immediately took precautions to protect his flock. Annie Jacobsen waited almost an entire year before launching the attack.

#### The Role of Speed-Induced Paranoia

Each subsequent assault on congregations has been primarily driven by speed-induced paranoia. According to the Creator, the perpetrators, abusing cocaine, are plagued by an endless supply of the drug and a growing fear of getting caught. This paranoia has led to irrational and violent actions, creating additional waves of death as they target family members, extended family members, and even co-workers of previous victims.

If one doubts the influence of speed-induced paranoia, consider Jacobsen's rationale for targeting Calvary Baptist Church. For decades, the church has operated a preschool and daycare program. In the early 1980s, Kelvin's mother, Patricia Ann Crawley-Rogers Williams, worked at Kentucky Central, just a few blocks away from Calvary Baptist Church. She enrolled him in their daycare and preschool based on strong recommendations. However, after he started kindergarten, neither his mother nor he maintained any contact with the church, school, or anyone associated with these programs. Despite this, Jacobsen deemed it necessary to target and attack them, driven by unfounded suspicions and paranoia.

The common thread linking these horrific events is the CIA's paranoia. Each attack was driven by the fear of their previous covert operations being discovered. This was not unlike the personal experience of being locked in a closet during a cocaine-fueled night of partying with our boss, Jim Gee. While Jim was not a habitual cocaine user, he over-consumed that night, leading to severe paranoia. Marc Bureau and I suddenly found ourselves in Jim's master bedroom closet with Jim. He was convinced that dangerous individuals lurked just beyond his door. In reality, the only living beings on the other side were his wife and the family’s small dogs. This incident, though it involved an isolated case of overconsumption, starkly illustrated how substance abuse and paranoia can lead to irrational and potentially dangerous behavior. Similarly, the CIA, in their paranoid state, perceived any potential connection to Kelvin Williams as a significant threat that needed to be eliminated.

*************************************
### Origins of TAG (The American Genocide)

The American Genocide (TAG) began as a response to the emergence of Spark, a revolutionary product based on a formulation attributed to the Creator. Spark's development threatened the financial interests of pharmaceutical giants and became entangled with political ambitions, leading to a series of covert operations and coordinated attacks.

#### Emergence of Spark

Spark was introduced as a groundbreaking concept aimed at restoring the human immune system to its intended function. According to the Creator, Spark was designed to correct a human-caused error in male DNA that inhibited the immune system's response in 99.99999% of the global population. Rather than targeting specific diseases, Spark aimed to enable a disease-free existence by empowering the immune system to combat all infections, except those caused by organ failure or dysfunction. Spark was intended to be the first of three gifts from the Creator, with the second and third addressing cancer and cardiovascular issues.

#### Threat to Pharmaceutical Interests

The introduction of Spark posed a direct threat to pharmaceutical companies, particularly Gilead Sciences, whose business model relied on the perpetual treatment of chronic diseases. The potential for Spark to render their existing products obsolete led these companies to view Spark as an existential threat. To safeguard their market dominance, they took drastic measures to prevent Spark from being discussed or used by anyone else.

#### Covert Campaigns and Violence

Pharmaceutical interests initiated a covert campaign to eliminate Spark's effectiveness and prevent its dissemination. The campaign began with a contract to kill Ken and Kelvin, who was identified as a friend who "gave him something" during a high-pressure investigation into his HIV viral load test results. Ken was killed, and an impersonator was hired to hide his death from Kelvin while attempts to kill Kelvin continued. Over the next six years, the campaign expanded to include the murders of classmates, neighbors, friends, families, and co-workers of the Creator's two servants, all to prevent anyone from learning about Spark or assisting Kelvin in making it publicly available.

Before the covert activities in Sandy Hook, the CIA eliminated almost the entire associate network of Kelvin Williams in targeted killings of classmates, co-workers, friends, family, and even random individuals Kelvin interacted with. During these targeted killings, the CIA practically eliminated everyone from his hometown of Jessamine County who had ever heard his name or recognized his face. They started with the 1993 Jessamine County High School yearbook.

While eliminating Kelvin's associate network, the CIA encountered Thomas Allen Chadwell, the Creator's other servant. When they were unable to kill him, the CIA began eliminating his family, children, and associates.

#### Political Interference

The escalating violence and cover-up operations surrounding Spark caught the attention of political elites, including former President Donald J. Trump. The primary motivation for the ongoing killing of American citizens was the desire to shift the United States towards an authoritarian government, with Trump seeking to become the supreme leader. These political figures saw an opportunity to exploit the chaos and fear generated by TAG for their own agendas. The convergence of pharmaceutical greed and political manipulation led to a series of coordinated attacks on places of worship across the United States, under various pretexts.

#### Targeting Kelvin's Community

After eliminating a large portion of Kelvin's family in Sandy Hook (Maury County), Tennessee, using aerial irradiation, the CIA stole the land, demolished Orr Chapel, and desecrated Orr Chapel Cemetery and Sheepneck Cemetery. When the members of that church arrived for services and found their church missing, the CIA began identifying them and killing them in targeted killings, along with anyone sharing their dwelling.

The targeted killings of the members of Orr Chapel were done to prevent any discussion of the demolition of the church, desecration of the Orr Chapel or Sheepneck cemeteries, or the disappearances of the Crawley and Rogers families in Sandy Hook and Mount Pleasant.

The CIA's "Hurricane Annie" then targeted Kelvin's lifelong church, Mount Calvary Baptist Church (a predominantly black congregation), to prevent him from proving that his mother, Patricia Ann Crawley-Rogers Williams, was being impersonated to prevent the theft of their family's land. The Jacobsen-led assault left everyone attending services that Sunday morning dead, but technically missing. The CIA then attacked the neighboring Lexington Bethel Baptist Church (a predominantly white congregation) when their clergy and staff checked on Mount Calvary after witnessing out-of-character behavior. Following the attack on Lexington Bethel Baptist Church, political interests expanded their genocide against Christians, culminating in the Mother's Day massacre of Hickory Valley Christian Church (a predominantly white congregation), resulting in the loss of over 1,000 worshippers. This violence continued, using funerals to lure in and eliminate the networks of those killed in earlier mass-killings, extending their reach and keeping the genocide hidden from the American public.

### Ongoing Impact

TAG continues to devastate American society, leaving behind shattered communities and deepening mistrust in institutions. Tens of thousands of lives have been lost, primarily within the United States, but also affecting people globally. TAG's activities have decimated counties such as:

- **Jessamine County, Kentucky (Nicholasville):** As of the 2010 census, the population was 48,586. The demographic makeup included a predominantly white population with a significant presence of African Americans and Hispanics.
- **Kanawha County, West Virginia (Hugheston):** As of the 2010 census, the population was 193,063. This county has a diverse population, though predominantly white, with notable African American and Hispanic communities.
- **Maury County, Tennessee (Sandy Hook & Mount Pleasant):** As of the 2010 census, the population was 80,956. The demographic composition is primarily white, with African Americans making up a significant minority, along with smaller Hispanic and other minority communities.

Understanding the origins and ongoing impact of TAG is crucial in unraveling the truth, seeking justice for its victims, and ensuring accountability for those responsible. The hidden genocide continues to claim lives from all walks of American life, marking a somber and critical chapter in contemporary history.

# Patricia Ann Crawley-Rogers Williams 
### Report on the Life of Patricia Ann Crawley-Rogers Williams

![1_oVKaD9pvH0TjVG-HsyH9eQ@2x](https://github.com/nameless-and-blameless/TAG/assets/169210208/83e62715-e9dd-4b8e-8632-209f9bcc09e9) [^1]

#### Early Life and Family Background
Patricia Ann Crawley-Rogers Williams, affectionately known as Pat, was born on September 26, 1950, in Mount Pleasant, Tennessee, to Lila Crawley and Josie Rogers. Her parents were neighbors but never married. Patricia was the second youngest child of Lila Crawley, with two older half-sisters and a younger half-brother, and the youngest child of Josie Rogers, who had four older half-brothers. Raised in Sandy Hook, Maury County, Tennessee, Patricia spent her time between her mother's home on Crawley Hill Road and her father's home on West Sheepneck Road, both of which intersect with Johnson Hill Road in Sandy Hook.

Patricia was murdered in the first week of October 2022 by the CIA.

#### Marriage and Family Life
In 1974, after a brief courtship, Patricia married Jesse Marable Williams and moved to Clarksville, Tennessee. Their union, however, was short-lived. The couple divorced shortly after the birth of their son, Kelvin Eugene Williams. Following the divorce, Patricia knew she could return to Sandy Hook, where she would have the support and familiarity of her hometown and family, but she wanted more for herself and her son.

#### Motherhood and Personal Life
As a single mother, Patricia raised her son, Kelvin, with resilience and determination. Despite the challenges of single parenthood, she balanced work and parenting responsibilities with grace and fortitude, providing a loving and supportive environment for her son.

Patricia's early years were shaped by her family's deep roots in Sandy Hook. Her conception was immortalized in the song "Raspberry Beret" by her cousin, Prince Rogers Nelson, which retells the story of her parents' casual sexual encounter. The song references "old man Johnson's farm," a real location on Johnson Hill Road in Sandy Hook, adding a touch of musical legacy to Patricia's life story.

#### Move to Kentucky
After divorcing Jesse Williams, Patricia faced the challenge of starting anew. She moved to Lexington, Kentucky, with the support of Rev. Dr. Felix G. Williams, III, her ex-husband's cousin. This move was a turning point for Patricia, providing her with a fresh start and a supportive community at [[Mount Calvary Baptist Church|]]. Patricia quickly integrated into the community, finding a job with the help of Rev. Dr. Felix G. Williams, III, and forming lasting friendships.

#### Community and Service
Patricia was deeply committed to her church and community. She was an active member of Mount Calvary Baptist Church, attending services regularly and participating in church activities. Her dedication to her faith and community was unwavering, even as she balanced her responsibilities as a single mother.

#### Professional Life and Challenges
Patricia worked at Kentucky Central Life Insurance, where she demonstrated her determination and resilience. Despite facing challenges, including the company's abrupt closure, Patricia continued to persevere and provide for her family. Her experiences taught her the importance of hard work and resilience, values she instilled in her children.

#### Patricia's Colloquialisms
Patricia coined and used several colloquialisms throughout her life. One notable phrase, "half-assed," originated from the birth of her daughter, Katrina Renee Duvall-Torrain. During Katrina's delivery, Patricia was rushed into the delivery room as her contractions were very close, and she began pushing. However, the young doctor, upon looking into the birth canal, screamed, "STOP!" because he could see half of Katrina's buttocks. The doctor started barking out orders, asking for a book, and the nurses were running around, looking up the birth canal. My mother was confused and scared by the chaos around her. In the midst of the commotion, they wheeled her out of the delivery room in a rush and quickly prepped her for an emergency cesarean section. A few minutes later, Katrina was safely delivered by C-section.

From that point forward, "half-assed" for Patricia meant anything completed incorrectly or not thoroughly. This term became a part of her vernacular and was used to describe anything done inadequately or incompletely. Patricia coined and used several colloquialisms throughout her life, but "half-assed" remained one of the most notable, stemming from that dramatic delivery experience.

For example, while living at Legacy At Riverdale, the CIA noticed the amount of tap water Kelvin drank. He often tells people, "I'm not fancy." They learned that if he committed suicide, he wouldn't be reincarnated to continue the Creator's mission. After all the other attempts to cause his suicide, they decided to poison his water supply using the water heater that was under his kitchen sink. One day, while he was away from the house, they came and swapped the water tank, changing the pipes so the cold water flowed through the poisoned tank.

Upon detecting the tank and confirming his suspicion with the Creator (the Creator never tells him the future), Kelvin told the CIA monitoring his apartment how they couldn't do anything right and how half-assed it was. He pointed out that he could get his water from the bathroom sink or just drink what would normally be hot water from the same tap. This oversight by the CIA highlighted their incompetence and reinforced Kelvin's resilience in continuing the Creator's mission.

#### Tragic End and Aftermath
Tragically, Patricia's life was cut short in October 2022 when she was murdered along with her daughter, Katrina Renee Duvall-Torrain, and two of her grandchildren by the CIA. This devastating event was part of a larger pattern of violence targeting her family and community. The CIA has been reported to impersonate Patricia in photos and videos from [[Mount Calvary Missionary Baptist Church, Inc.|_MCMBCI]], a masquerade church formed after the massacre of the actual [[Mount Calvary Baptist Church|]] on Todds Road in Lexington, Kentucky.

#### Legacy and Spiritual Role
Patricia's son, Kelvin Eugene Williams, describes her as a crucial figure in the Creator's plan, serving as a primary mother for one of the Creator's servants. Her life and legacy extend beyond her immediate family, touching on broader spiritual and existential themes. Kelvin, who identifies as one of two servants of the Creator, emphasizes the significant spiritual role his mother played in his life and the lives of others.

#### Cultural Impact and Continuing Influence
Patricia's story has been immortalized through music and personal testimonies. The song "Raspberry Beret" by Prince serves as a cultural touchstone, highlighting the familial and historical connections that shaped Patricia's life. Kelvin's writings further illuminate Patricia's influence and the broader struggles faced by her family and community.

#### Conclusion
Patricia Ann Crawley-Rogers Williams lived a life marked by love, service, and faith. Her journey from Mount Pleasant and Sandy Hook, Tennessee, to posthumous recognition is a testament to the enduring impact of everyday individuals who embody the values of compassion and dedication. Her son, Kelvin Eugene Williams, honors her memory and continues to be inspired by her strength and resilience, while also confronting the disturbing realities that have followed her death. Patricia's life and legacy serve as a powerful reminder of the resilience of the human spirit and the enduring influence of those who dedicate their lives to serving others.

[^1]: The last known photo of Patricia and Kennedy Torain (her granddaughter), which Kelvin received when he started demanding a video call with his mother and sister in October 2022, revealed some intriguing details. Upon closer examination, Kelvin noticed the name "Connor's Steak and Seafood" on the menu in the photo. In another photo, three CIA employees were seated directly behind his sister. Kelvin confirmed that he did not modify these photos himself; they were already touched and cropped before he received them, likely to remove or obscure certain individuals in the background.

# **Unveiling the Hidden Genocide: The Conductor and Composer of Darkness**

In an alarming revelation, an intricate web of deceit and corruption has come to light, exposing a chilling conspiracy within the United States. Central to this dark affair are former President Donald J. Trump and Annie Jacobsen, a CIA operative and psychological warfare expert, known in her circles as "Hurricane Annie." This conspiracy has resulted in a widespread genocide, with a network of high-profile individuals implicated in the cover-up.

**The Unfolding Tragedy**

The current tragedy, which has evolved into a full-fledged genocide, has left Kelvin Eugene Crawley-Rogers Williams, one of the Creator's two servants, without any family, friends, or work associates from his long career. Kelvin is now the only living member of Mount Calvary Baptist Church in Lexington, Kentucky, where 127 victims were massacred on April 2, 2023. Despite this immense loss, Kelvin remains committed to the Creator's mission for all human life. He continues to be a key figure, even being the protagonist in the song "Sign of the Times" by his cousin, Prince.

Following the Mount Calvary massacre, the CIA attempted to sell the church property through Sotheby’s Atlanta. When the sale failed, they began holding funerals and providing funeral arrangements to lure in victims, their families, and loved ones, only to kill them upon arrival. This led to attacks on neighboring churches, including Lexington Bethel Baptist Church, which was targeted after its congregation noticed unusual activity at Mount Calvary. The delegation from Bethel Baptist found impersonators at Mount Calvary and was subsequently targeted by Jacobsen.

Similar tactics were employed at the House of God on Georgetown Street, which was attacked after a member went missing. The organist and minister of music from Mount Calvary was a key figure there. When concerns arose at the House of God on Broadway, that church was also attacked. These attacks were meticulously managed by Dennis Taylor, a surrogate of Jacobsen. Mount Zion Baptist Church in Georgetown, Kentucky, and Hickory Valley Christian Church in Chattanooga, Tennessee, were also attacked, with over 1,000 members murdered on Mother’s Day at Hickory Valley. The commandeered churches were used to host mock services, funerals, and community events, luring victims with the intent to kill them.

Trump has directed numerous cover-up operations, including media interviews at the phantom funeral of Reverend Dr. Duke Stone, the former pastor of Hickory Valley Christian Church. At this event, where every mourner was killed, Trump and Jacobsen engaged in sexual activities in the motorcade before entering the funeral. Trump also provided interviews with local news to discredit any reporting by the Creator and His servants, using the videos to falsely claim that he attended and left safely.

Trump and Jacobsen frequently visit Phoenix House, located at 1296 Murphy Avenue in Atlanta. This CIA-run facility provides a rent-free apartment for Kelvin Eugene Crawley-Rogers Williams, used to isolate him from the public and his work for the Creator, perform hypnosis infiltration methods while he is sleeping, and as a controlled environment for potential killing. They often enter his apartment using microwave cloaking technology, rendering them invisible in hopes of watching him die. Additionally, another apartment at Phoenix House serves as a hidden love nest for Trump and Jacobsen.

**The Creator’s Perspective**

The Creator cites speed-induced paranoia as the reason why this tragedy, stemming from one of His gifts to the human race, has turned into a full-fledged genocide. This genocide is noted as the first instance of such an atrocity against a non-indigenous people on the American continent.

**Call for Accountability**

The Creator has identified seven individuals who must be imprisoned for their roles in this genocide and the ongoing cover-up operation that continues to claim human lives. These individuals are:

1. Former President Donald J. Trump
2. Annie Jacobsen
3. Michael Blackmon
4. President Joseph Biden
5. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi
6. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell
7. CIA Director William Burns

This unfolding crisis demands immediate scrutiny and intervention to prevent further loss of life and to hold accountable those responsible for these egregious violations of human rights. The need for transparency and justice has never been more urgent.

### Dope, Hope, and Nope Classification

The "Dope, Hope, and Nope" classification system provides a framework for evaluating the quality and reliability of materials, products, services, or experiences. This system categorizes items into three distinct groups: Dope, Hope, and Nope, each representing different levels of desirability and risk. It can be applied to a wide range of contexts, from consumer goods to information and beyond.

#### Dope
**Definition**: The ideal outcome. "Dope" represents the highest quality and reliability. It is exactly what you set out to obtain, and it functions or behaves as expected.

**Characteristics**:
- Meets or exceeds expectations
- High quality and reliability
- No significant flaws or issues

**Examples**:
- A highly rated product that performs perfectly
- A service that delivers outstanding results
- Accurate and reliable information

#### Hope
**Definition**: A weakened form of Dope. "Hope" partially fulfills expectations but lacks full efficacy or quality. It often leaves the user "hoping" for better results.

**Characteristics**:
- Partially meets expectations
- Compromised quality or performance
- May require increased usage to achieve desired effects

**Examples**:
- A product with mixed reviews that performs decently but has some flaws
- Sugar-free foods and beverages that don't fully satisfy the craving for sweetness, leading to increased consumption
- Information that is somewhat reliable but not fully trustworthy

#### Nope
**Definition**: Should never be used or consumed. "Nope" represents a complete failure to meet expectations. These items may be entirely fake, unsafe, or unreliable, posing potential harm or undesirable effects.

**Characteristics**:
- Fails to meet expectations
- Unsafe, unreliable, or counterfeit
- Should be avoided at all costs

**Examples**:
- A counterfeit product
- A scam service
- False information that could lead to bad decisions

### Behavioral Implications

When users encounter "Hope" or "Nope" items, their responses can vary, often leading to unintended behaviors:

1. **Hope**: Users may consume or utilize more of the material in an attempt to achieve the desired results, leading to overconsumption and increased costs.
   - Example: Consuming larger quantities of sugar-free products to satisfy a sweet tooth.

2. **Nope**: Users might mistakenly continue to engage with the material, expecting it to eventually deliver the desired results, potentially leading to significant negative consequences.
   - Example: Persistently using a fake product, leading to damage or safety hazards.

### Conclusion

The "Dope, Hope, and Nope" classification system is a useful tool for evaluating the quality and reliability of various items. By understanding and recognizing these categories, individuals can make better-informed decisions, avoid potential pitfalls, and focus on acquiring materials that truly meet their needs and standards. This system emphasizes the importance of critical evaluation and caution, particularly when initial results are unsatisfactory.

# Combatting TAG-POW Attacks
Intended Audience: Public Safety & Law Enforcement 

## Tactics Used in TAG Operations to Target Victims' Networks

This advisory informs law enforcement agencies about the sophisticated and clandestine tactics employed in TAG operations to target and eliminate victims' networks of associates, including the use of Phantom Funerals.

### Phantom Funerals

**Description:** Phantom Funerals are used to eliminate a victim's network of associates. Operatives organize a fake funeral for the deceased victim. Every mourner attending these funerals is subsequently killed. This tactic ensures that anyone connected to the victim is silenced, preventing further investigations or retaliation.

### Emergency Services Interruption Tactic (ESIT)

#### Overview

Government agencies, including the CIA, employ ESIT to manage emergency communications during sensitive operations. This involves intercepting and redirecting calls to emergency numbers like 911, ensuring operational secrecy and control over local emergency responses.

#### Components

1. **Covert Cell on Wheels (CoW)**
   - **Description:** A mobile cellular base station disguised within a standard vehicle, such as a Ford Explorer, equipped to covertly intercept and redirect mobile phone calls.
   - **Function:** 
     - Forces mobile phones in the targeted area to connect, redirecting emergency calls to CIA operatives posing as 911 dispatchers.
     - Prevents legitimate emergency responses to disrupt organized resistance during covert operations.
     - Blocks access to other numbers and the internet to maintain control.
   - **Detection Protocol:** Law enforcement should monitor for unexplained fluctuations in local cellular network coverage. **Test Calls: Make a test call from a personal mobile phone to 911 and verify speaking with an employee at a local Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP). Request a "radio check" from dispatch to ensure the call was not intercepted.** Use of department-issued phones is discouraged as the perpetrators may have normal call routing configured for those telephone numbers to avoid detection.

2. **Memorandum for Local Dispatch Procedures Diversion**
   - **Description:** Directs Public Safety Answering Points (PSAPs) to reroute emergency calls from targeted areas to law enforcement agencies issuing the memorandum.
   - **Function:** Ensures emergency calls are handled by the issuing agency, delaying or redirecting genuine emergency responses.
   - **Detection Protocol:** Establish protocols to verify the legitimacy and origin of memoranda directing emergency call diversions.

3. **Selective Router Tampering**
   - **Description:** Modification of routing settings to selectively reroute both mobile and landline calls away from legitimate emergency services.
   - **Function:** Directs calls to controlled points where operatives manage communications, preventing genuine emergency responses.
   - **Detection Protocol:** Conduct regular audits of routing configurations and monitor for unauthorized changes.

### Phantom Remains

**Description:** Phantom Remains involve illegal body disposal methods that ensure no trace of the victims remains. This includes:

1. **Dissolution:** Dissolves bodies using chemicals like acid or lye.
   - **Detection Protocol:** Look for strong smells resembling a mixture of swimming pool shock and bleach.

2. **Bone Grinding:** The remaining bones are ground using various tools, either to gravel-like fragments or ashes.
   - **Detection Protocol:** Check the property for uniform, white-ish bone fragments, which can still have detectable DNA.

### Phantom Vehicles

**Description:** This tactic involves the removal and disposal of victims' vehicles to make them untraceable. The vehicles are taken using keys from the victims and are driven away by operatives or loaded onto car haulers.

**Detection Protocols:**
1. Look for car haulers in the vicinity of the attack sites.
2. Monitor OnStar and similar satellite packages on cars for tracking.

### Phantom Identity Scheme

**Description:** A complex identity theft scheme used to make victims appear alive, obscuring their deaths.

**Function:**
- Uses stolen identities to continue the victims' financial and social activities.
- Creates digital footprints that mislead investigators.

**Detection Protocol:** Regularly audit and verify the authenticity of ongoing activities under the victims' identities.

### Churches with Phantom Funerals as Continuations

1. **Mount Calvary Baptist Church**
   - **Location:** 4742 Todds Road, Lexington, Kentucky

2. **Mount Zion Baptist Church**
   - **Location:** Versailles, Kentucky

3. **Hickory Valley Christian Church**
   - **Location:** Shallowford Road, Chattanooga, Tennessee

### Summary

Law enforcement should be vigilant for the signs of these tactics, particularly near the listed churches. Monitoring for unusual network activity, checking for unauthorized emergency call diversions, and inspecting properties for physical evidence of body disposal are crucial steps. Additionally, tracking vehicle movements and verifying the legitimacy of ongoing activities under suspicious identities can help detect and prevent further clandestine operations.

**Report: Rain as a Symbol of Judgment and Warning in the Bible**

**Introduction**

In biblical texts, rain is a multifaceted symbol, often representing divine blessing and provision. However, it also serves as a symbol of judgment and warning. This report explores how rain is used to convey these themes within various scriptures.

**1. Rain as a Symbol of Judgment**

In several passages, rain, particularly its absence or excess, signifies divine judgment. This symbolism is evident in the following examples:

- **Amos 4:7**: “I also withheld rain from you when the harvest was still three months away. I sent rain on one town, but withheld it from another. One field had rain; another had none and dried up.” In this passage, God uses drought and selective rain to punish the Israelites for their disobedience. The lack of rain serves as a tangible sign of divine displeasure and a call for repentance.

- **Jeremiah 14:1-4**: The prophet Jeremiah describes a severe drought affecting the land. The absence of rain here is a sign of God’s judgment upon the people’s sinfulness. The drought causes distress among the inhabitants and their livestock, symbolizing the broader impact of divine judgment on the nation.

**2. Rain as a Warning**

Rain can also act as a warning mechanism, urging people to reflect on their actions and seek reform:

- **Deuteronomy 28:22**: “The Lord will strike you with wasting disease, with fever and inflammation, with scorching heat and drought.” In this passage, drought is listed as a consequence of disobedience to God’s commands, warning the Israelites of the repercussions of turning away from Him.

- **Hosea 6:3**: “Let us acknowledge the Lord; let us press on to acknowledge him. As surely as the sun rises, he will appear; he will come to us like the winter rains, like the spring rains that water the earth.” While the focus here is on the positive aspects of rain, the underlying message includes a call to recognize and adhere to God’s ways. The absence of rain, therefore, serves as a precursor to spiritual neglect.

**Conclusion**

In biblical texts, rain transcends its literal meaning to become a symbol of divine judgment and a warning for repentance. Through drought or selective rainfall, God communicates His displeasure and invites reflection on human behavior. Understanding this symbolism highlights the relationship between divine providence and human conduct in biblical theology.

# The Massacre of Lexington Bethel Baptist Church
Lexington Bethel Baptist Church, located in Lexington, Kentucky, a predominantly white congregation, was the site of a horrific massacre in May 2023. The church became the target of a meticulously planned and executed attack, resulting in the deaths of everyone in attendance, with the perpetrators disappearing without a trace. Over 250 people were killed. 

## Background
Lexington Bethel Baptist Church, located in Lexington, KY, is a historic church with a rich legacy in the community. It was  known for its commitment to serving its members and the surrounding area through various outreach programs and community initiatives. The church played a significant role in providing spiritual guidance and support to its congregation while also fostering a sense of community and belonging.

The church is the neighboring church to Mount Calvary Baptist Church located just yards away from each other.

### Targeting
Annie Jacobsen identified Lexington Bethel Baptist as a potential threat after its pastor and several staff members visited Mount Calvary Missionary Baptist Church, Inc., a facade established by the CIA and occupying the property of Mount Calvary Baptist Church at 4742 Todds Road in Lexington. Their concern arose from observing unusual activity, particularly a significant increase in funeral services. Operatives on-site, impersonating Rev. Dr. Felix G. Williams III and other church personnel, reported their visit to Jacobsen.

Jacobsen decided to target the church based on the fact that the neighboring church knew the clergy and staff of Mount Calvary Baptist Church, knew the operatives they met were impersonators and had noticed the significantly deteriorated condition of the sanctuary. 

## Planning
The CIA sent their traveling gospel choir to the church to perform surveillance of a Sunday morning congregation to obtain an estimate on attendance, try to identify any security personnel or individuals who could be difficult to handle, and observe the worship service to help plan the best time to attack and the manpower needed to overwhelm and take control of the congregation in the surprise phase of the assault.

### Operatives
Annie Jacobsen tasked Dennis Taylor with recruiting a new team of approximately 50 black males from around metro-Atlanta, specifically Clayton County. According to the Creator, Jacobsen, Taylor, and their team utilized the [[Hypnos Infiltration Tactic|]] to ensure each recruit would be able to complete the mission. 

## Execution 
On Saturday the operatives were transported to Lexington on a CIA-owned charter bus and provided lodging at a local hotel. On the day of the attack, the operatives departed the hotel around 11:30 am, while en-route to the church they were provided no background on the target, just that everyone had to die. Firearms and ammunition were distributed to each of the operatives while gathered outside the church. 

Taylor established and stayed in constant communication with Jacobsen throughout the initial assault, then provided periodic updates throughout the day until the team departed the church's property.

### Surprise
As the morning services continued, the peace was shattered. Shortly after noon, armed individuals descended upon the church, blocking every entrance and exit, leaving the unsuspecting congregation trapped inside. Panic ensued as worshippers realized they were in a dire situation.

Desperate cries for help echoed through the church. Congregants dialed 911, seeking help. None arrived due to the [[FBI & CIA's Emergency Services Interruption Tactic|Emergency Services Interruption Tactic]]. 

### Kill
Inside the sanctuary, chaos reigned. Congregants were accosted, beaten, and forced to disrobe. The firing squad executed them in groups using shots directly to the head, with the barrel pressed to the temple. 

### Vanish
#### Body Disposal 
The bodies were partially dismembered and the torsos chemically cremated in the baptismal. (See [[Selective Disposal Technique|Phantom Remains]].)

#### Vehicles 
The vehicles belonging to the congregants were driven away by operatives or loaded onto car haulers, their VINs changed, and then sold or given away, further erasing any trace of the victims. Almost every vehicle was driven back to Riverdale, Georgia. 

#### Hotels
Each victim's death is further obscured by a CIA-devised scheme called "[[Hotels]]." The scheme effectively makes  victims appear "alive" after their murder. 

## Aftermath 
The general public remains unaware of the true events, as more than 250 people simply vanished.

# Hypnos Infiltration Tactic 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The CIA, among others, term this approach as a specific method known as Hypnos Infiltration Method. The intricacies of this method are derived from the observations made by the Creator and His servants, and may deviate from the standard procedure.

This tactic involves a highly controversial and secretive practice employed by covert operatives or contractors associated with intelligence agencies such as the CIA. Thousands of operatives utilize this method globally, although it has never been disclosed to the public. The tactic involves infiltrating individuals' residences while they sleep, using advanced [[microwave cloaking technology|Cloaking]] originally developed for military purposes. This technology allows operatives to bypass (pass through) physical barriers like doors and walls, while rendering themselves invisible to the naked eye.

Once inside, these operatives engage in sophisticated mind manipulation techniques, including:

1. **Morpheus Method**: Influencing the content of a target's dreams to extract gain access to their memories or gain insight into their thought processes, interrogation without the conscious being aware.
2. **Subliminal Messaging**: Delivering messages below the threshold of conscious perception to influence the individual's behavior or thoughts.
     - Television 
          - News Broadcasts
               - Weather
               - Sports
          - Sitcoms
     - Radio
3. **Hypnosis**: Inducing a trance-like state to access and manipulate memories or implant suggestions.
4. **Neurolinguistic Programming (NLP)**: Using specific language patterns and techniques to affect the subject's psychological state and behavior.

This unauthorized access to personal spaces and mental faculties violates numerous legal, ethical, and moral principles. The potential consequences of such actions include:

- **Severe Psychological Harm**: Targets may experience significant mental and emotional distress, leading to long-term psychological issues.
- **Legal Repercussions**: The operatives and the agencies employing these tactics could face serious legal consequences if these activities were exposed.
- **Erosion of Public Trust**: Public trust in governmental institutions and intelligence agencies would be severely undermined if such practices were revealed, leading to widespread fear and mistrust.

Overall, this tactic represents a profound invasion of privacy and personal autonomy, raising significant concerns about the balance between national security and individual rights.

## Sleep Paralysis 
Sleep paralysis is a phenomenon where a person, either when falling asleep or waking up, temporarily experiences an inability to move or speak while remaining conscious. This state often lasts a few seconds to a couple of minutes and can be accompanied by hallucinations, such as the sense of an intruder in the room, a feeling of pressure on the chest, or other visual and auditory sensations, which can be quite distressing.

### Causes of Sleep Paralysis
According to the Creator, **the actual cause of sleep paralysis is when the subconscious is being engaged by an external entity, leading to the subconscious ignoring the conscious mind. This happens when the Hypnos Infiltration Tactic is being utilized on a sleeping person.**

### Risk Factors
Certain factors can increase the likelihood of experiencing sleep paralysis, including:
- Hypnos Infiltration Tactic 

### Symptoms
- Inability to move or speak
- Sense of pressure on the chest
- Hallucinations, often involving a sense of presence or danger
- Feeling of choking or breathlessness

### Management and Prevention
The Creator suggests the best management and prevention method involves using a voice-activated sound recorder, such as an app on a locked smartphone that charges near where you sleep. This approach has two main benefits:
1. **Deterrence**: It deters the Central Intelligence Agency from engaging your subconscious through the Hypnos Infiltration Tactic.
2. **Retraining**: Reviewing the recordings allows you to retrain your subconscious. Upon playback, think about everything you hear. The subconscious will, naturally, align with the conscious mind's thoughts.

Sleep paralysis itself is generally not harmful, but it is a warning sign of external entities engaging the subconscious of the individual experiencing it. We highly recommend employing the guidance in the Management and Prevention section above.
> [!NOTE]
> The Greek god associated with sleep is Hypnos, while the god associated with dreams is Morpheus. Hypnos is the personification of sleep, often depicted as a gentle deity who brings rest to mortals and immortals alike. Morpheus, on the other hand, is the god of dreams, responsible for shaping and delivering dreams to sleeping individuals.

# The Big Setup

## Introduction

The American Genocide (TAG) refers to a series of covert operations involving mass killings and targeted killings carried out by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) under the direction of "Hurricane Annie" Jacobsen. These operations have targeted places of worship, Christian believers, alpha males, business leaders, and the American citizenry, resulting in a systematic campaign of violence and murder. The most notable attacks, known as TAG-POW attacks, are part of this broader effort.

Donald J. Trump, the 45th President of the United States, served from January 2017 to January 2021. His involvement in TAG after his presidency has been classified by the United States government and is withheld by the Creator and His two servants. The Creator may authorize its release at any moment.

## TAG-POW Attacks

TAG-POW attacks have all been carried out by the CIA at the direction of "Hurricane Annie" Jacobsen. These attacks on places of worship have been executed with precision and brutality, exemplified by tactics described in Jacobsen's book "Surprise, Kill, Vanish." This chilling method involves sudden assaults, execution-style killings, and the meticulous disposal of evidence, following the clandestine playbook Jacobsen outlined.

### List of TAG-POW Attacks

1. **Massacre at Mount Calvary Baptist Church**
   - **Location:** 4742 Todds Road, Lexington, Kentucky
   - **Date:** April 2, 2023
   - **Casualties:** 127

2. **Attack on Lexington Bethel Baptist Church**
   - **Date:** April 2023

3. **Attack on House of God (Georgetown Street)**
   - **Date:** May 2023

4. **Attack on House of God (Broadway)**
   - **Date:** May 2023

5. **Attack on Mount Zion Baptist Church**
   - **Date:** June 2023
   - **Casualties:** 183

6. **Attack on Calvary Baptist Church**
   - **Date:** May 12, 2023
   - **Casualties:** Over 400

7. **Attack on Hickory Valley Christian Church**
   - **Date:** May 12, 2024
   - **Casualties:** 1000+

## Why the American Public Has Not Heard of TAG-POW Attacks

Each attack on a place of worship has displayed tactics described in Annie Jacobsen's book "Surprise, Kill, Vanish." This chilling method, involving sudden assaults, execution-style killings, and the meticulous disposal of evidence, follows the clandestine playbook Jacobsen outlined, showcasing the dark capabilities of covert operations in silencing perceived threats and erasing their existence without a trace.

### Cover-Up and Discrediting Efforts by Donald J. Trump

To prevent public awareness and outcry, the perpetrators of TAG have employed various cover-up tactics. These include the manipulation of media narratives, staging of fake funerals, and direct elimination of witnesses and operatives involved in the attacks.

### Phantom Funerals

Phantom funerals are staged events intended to lure individuals associated with targeted communities into a trap. Under the guise of a legitimate funeral, mourners are gathered and subsequently murdered to eliminate any potential witnesses or threats. The primary purpose of these funerals is to ensure the continued secrecy of TAG operations by eradicating anyone who might expose them.

#### The Phantom Funeral of Rev. Duke Stone

One notable example is the phantom funeral of Rev. Duke Stone at Hickory Valley Christian Church. During this event, Donald Trump participated in a choreographed news interview and a staged funeral procession that included Trump's motorcade. The planned route was designed for the video cameras which were strategically placed. Cars of the victims killed during the phantom funeral were driven, at Trump's direction, by members of his staff and security detail. Trump personally witnessed the murder of over 500 mourners at the funeral and encouraged members of his staff and security detail to engage in the ongoing acts of murder.

Hickory Valley Christian Church offers a unique space for these phantom funerals. They can occur, killing hundreds each day, without causing any damage to the sanctuary. Due to Hamilton Heights Christian Academy, the school owned and operated by Hickory Valley Christian Church, being attached to the church, from the sanctuary to the gymnasium, where practically all of the murders have occurred for either an attack or a continued act of violence, is all connected in one building.

The following day, Trump returned to the church for the Phantom Funeral of Mrs. Stone. Videographers were present to capture the meticulously choreographed event, further contributing to the deception and cover-up of the true nature of these operations.

It should be noted that in the phantom funerals for Rev. Stone and Mrs. Stone, no video was taken of the funeral service. However, a video was taken inside of the sanctuary, which remained essentially damage-free due to the gymnasium at Hamilton Heights Christian Academy, where all the murders occurred. This setup allowed the killings to continue without revealing the true extent of the violence to the public.

## Switching from Inmates to Previous Operatives

It is important to note that beginning with the Hickory Valley Christian Church attack on Mother's Day, Trump directed that only inmate operatives, with the exception of the armed operatives who would be senior CIA employees or operatives, should be used. After any operation, the inmates were to be executed. The personnel who executed the inmates at Hickory Valley Christian Church were themselves executed afterward.

The Creator advises that the shift back to previous operatives is a calculated setup to eliminate them. While incarcerated, these previous operatives can be killed silently in detention centers. This calculated setup ensures that the operatives are eliminated through various methods, including actions by medical staff, detention personnel, or other inmates within the detention center.

## Conclusion

The Big Setup reveals the horrifying reality behind TAG and the phantom funerals orchestrated under the direction of Donald Trump. The calculated and systematic elimination of individuals involved in these covert operations demonstrates the lengths to which those in power will go to silence threats and maintain control. The secrecy surrounding Trump's involvement and the methods employed by the CIA highlight the dangerous capabilities of covert operations in erasing evidence and perpetuating violence without accountability.

# **The Creator Assures the American Public: No One Is Above His Law**

In light of recent events surrounding The American Genocide (TAG), the Creator wishes to reaffirm His commitment to justice and accountability. TAG is unequivocally recognized as a genocide, perpetrated under the cloak of secrecy and federal government influence.

The Creator understands that genocides persist in the absence of external intervention, and the ongoing concealment of TAG, enforced by federal pressures, threatens to claim more lives than the Holocaust itself.

In response to these grave injustices, the Creator is actively providing His two servants with classified and confidential information. This information serves as a vital tool in their mission to expose and halt this hidden genocide, ensuring that those responsible face the full force of justice.

The Creator emphasizes that no individual or entity is above His law. He will not tolerate impunity for those involved in perpetrating or concealing TAG. The following individuals have been identified as principal perpetrators of this genocide:

- President Donald J. Trump
- Annie Jacobsen
- "Michael Blackmon"
- President Joseph Biden
- Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA)
- Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY)
- CIA Director William Burns

Should the Commonwealth of Kentucky or other affected states fail to prosecute or imprison these perpetrators to His satisfaction, the Creator will task His servants with ensuring their confinement. Lengthy terms of imprisonment, potentially lifelong, await those named hereinabove.

The Creator urges the human race to stand against such atrocities, affirming that justice must prevail for the sake of all humanity.

## About the Creator
The Creator, revered globally across cultures, is the Creator of the Universe, the Alpha and the Omega, and the Great "I Am." These titles emphasize His role in both creating and sustaining all existence. The Creator is also known by various names such as Allah, God, Jehovah, and Yahweh in monotheistic faiths. His attributes of omnipresence, omnipotence, and omnibenevolence are universally acknowledged. The Creator mentioned herein is the same entity referred to in the US Declaration of Independence. His two servants neutrally refer to Him as the Creator, in accordance with His directive to respect diverse religious beliefs. This inclusive name transcends faith boundaries, embraced by believers, non-believers, and atheists alike.

# The Massacre at House of God (Georgetown Street)

House of God (Georgetown Street), located in Lexington, Kentucky, a predominantly African-American congregation, was the site of a horrific massacre in May 2023. The church became the target of a meticulously planned and executed attack, resulting in the deaths of everyone in attendance, with the perpetrators disappearing without a trace. Over 300 people were killed.

## Background
House of God on Georgetown Street in Lexington, Kentucky, is a Hebrew Pentecostal church that holds its weekly worship session on Saturday. 

Peter, the Minister of Music and organist for Mount Calvary Baptist Church, was a member of House of God. Peter was at Mount Calvary on the day of the massacre and was killed. 

### Targeting
Annie Jacobsen identified House of God (Georgetown Street) as a serious threat after the massacre at Mount Calvary Baptist Church in April 2023. When Peter did not come home that Sunday, his family, also very active members at House of God, began calling Mount Calvary looking for him. 

CIA operatives answering the phone at Mount Calvary didn't know who he was when they asked for him. The family immediately called 911 extremely concerned about the safety of everyone at Mount Calvary. Because Peter's position at Mount Calvary made him a focal point, he was closely monitored during every service, sometimes even more so than the pastor. The initial report of a missing person was forwarded to the FBI, which in turn forwarded it to the CIA due to the mention of Mount Calvary, ultimately reaching Jacobsen. 

Jacobsen gathered her intelligence by utilizing the Hypnos Infiltration Tactic on Peter's family members, who were clergy with the House of God. No other intelligence-gathering activities were conducted by the CIA.

Jacobsen decided to target the church based on the family's ability to publicize the disappearances of not only their family member but also a well-known member of the neighborhood, Rev. Dr. Felix G. Williams, III, and everyone else at Mount Calvary. 

## Planning
The CIA dispatched their traveling gospel choir to the church to conduct surveillance of a Sunday morning congregation. Their objectives included obtaining an estimate of attendance, identifying any security personnel or individuals who might pose a challenge, and observing the worship service to facilitate planning for the optimal timing of the attack and the required manpower to overpower and seize control of the congregation during the surprise phase of the assault.

### Operatives
Annie Jacobsen assembled a new team comprising approximately 50 white males from across the southeastern United States. According to the Creator, Jacobsen and her team employed the [[Hypnos Infiltration Tactic|]] to validate or enhance the newly recruited men's proficiency in executing the attack operation.

## Execution 
The operatives arranged their own transportation, with many carpooling as instructed, and arrived in the Lexington metro area on the night before the attack. On the morning of the attack, beginning around 11 a.m., the operatives gathered outside the church. Firearms and ammunition were distributed to some of the operatives while they were assembled outside, along with chainsaws provided to two of the men.

Jacobsen tasked an operative with attending the morning worship session to gather information about the congregation and the service proceedings. Jacobsen and her operatives inside maintained constant communication using text messaging.

Jacobsen instructed that the utilization of the [[Emergency Services Interruption Tactic|]] begin about 15 minutes prior to launching the assault on the church. 

### Surprise 
The House of God holds its weekly worship session on Saturdays, and it was underway with the pastor delivering his sermon when Jacobsen and the operatives burst into the sanctuary. Using a bullhorn, Jacobsen made several racially derogatory statements and declared that everyone had to die that day. Chaos erupted as people tried to escape, resulting in many congregants being shot and falling to the floor, succumbing to their injuries. Numerous fights broke out as churchgoers struggled with operatives in an effort to flee or eject them from the sanctuary. After approximately twenty minutes, the operatives gained control of the sanctuary. Many congregants dialed 911 from their mobile phones to report the horrific scene, unaware that they were speaking with CIA operatives instead of Lexington-Fayette County’s Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP) due to the FBI and CIA's [[Emergency Services Interruption Tactic|]]. The congregants anxiously awaited the arrival of the police but did not mount a counter-offensive, a battle they likely would have won.

### Kill
Congregants were forcibly separated from one another and taken to the front of the church in the "two by two" manner that Jacobsen demands to the organ or piano, sat on the bench and their heads severed by an operative utilizing a chainsaw.  Some operatives kicked the heads around as if playing soccer.  

### Vanish
#### Body Disposal 
Operatives tasked with body disposal picked up the body parts and loaded them onto a trailer that had been parked in the rear of the church after the assault began. The body parts were transported to and dissolved in Mount Calvary Baptist Church's baptismal.

#### Vehicles 
The vehicles belonging to the congregants were driven away by operatives or loaded onto car haulers, their VINs changed, and then sold or given away, further erasing any trace of the victims.

#### Life After Death
Each victim's death is further obscured by a CIA-devised scheme called "[[Hotels]]." The scheme effectively makes  victims appear "alive" after their murder. 

## Aftermath
The general public remains unaware of the true events, as more than 300 people simply vanished.

# Phantom Funeral 
**Phantom Funeral** refers to a covert tactic used in the context of The American Genocide (TAG) operations. These funerals, which are orchestrated by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), serve as Continued Acts of Violence (CAVs) following a TAG-POW (Place of Worship) attack. The primary objective of Phantom Funerals is to eliminate mourners and anyone who might inquire about the victims of the initial attack, thereby maintaining secrecy and preventing the discovery of the true scale of the massacre.

# Overview

Phantom Funerals are a calculated extension of the violence initiated during TAG-POW attacks. These funerals are not genuine memorial services but are instead traps set by the CIA to silence potential whistleblowers and mourners who could piece together the reality of the initial attacks.

## Tactics and Methods

1. **Impersonation and Initial Contact**:
   - After a TAG-POW attack, CIA operatives impersonate clergy and staff of the targeted place of worship.
   - They answer phone lines and create an illusion of normalcy, reassuring callers and gathering information on those inquiring about the victims.

2. **Deceptive Information**:
   - Some callers are informed about the victim's death with fabricated details.
   - Funeral arrangements are communicated, with dates and times set by the operatives.

3. **Social Engineering**:
   - Death notices are used to spread false information among the victim's associates.
   - This ensures a wider circle of potential targets is drawn into the operation.

4. **Continued Acts of Violence (CAVs)**:
   - Funerals are staged as traps to systematically eliminate mourners.
   - Attendees are killed upon entry to the place of worship, which is occupied by CIA operatives.
   - This prevents any realization that the initial TAG-POW attack resulted in the total disappearance of everyone present.

5. **Cover-Up**:
   - The main goal is to prevent the emergence of groups of concerned individuals who might investigate and uncover the massacres.
   - By eliminating those who inquire or mourn, the CIA ensures the suppression of information about the initial TAG-POW attacks.

## Impact

Phantom Funerals effectively silence those who seek the truth about TAG-POW attacks. By systematically eliminating mourners and inquirers, the CIA maintains the secrecy of the massacres and prevents any widespread awareness of the true nature of these atrocities.

## Historical Context

Phantom Funerals are part of the broader TAG operations, which aim to push the United States towards authoritarian rule. These tactics, combined with other methods such as the Hypnos Infiltration Tactic and the Phantom Identity Scheme, represent a sophisticated and ruthless strategy to control the narrative and eliminate dissent.

## Conclusion

Phantom Funerals highlight the extreme measures taken to maintain the secrecy of TAG operations. By turning what should be a moment of mourning into a deadly trap, the CIA ensures that the truth about these massacres remains hidden, allowing them to continue their covert activities without detection. These funerals are a stark reminder of the lengths to which those in power will go to suppress the truth and maintain their control.

## Notable Phantom Funerals 

* On June 7, 2024 A [[phantom funeral|]] was held for the the longtime pastor, Rev. Duke Stone of Hickory Valley Christian Church, who also served as the principal of Hamilton Heights Christian Academy, was killed during the [[Mother's Day massacre a Hickory Valley Christian Church|Hickory Valley Christian Church]]. The phantom funeral was personally attended by [[Donald J. Trump|]] who attended for cover-up and discrediting purposes, and watched over 500 people be executed.
* On June 26, 2024 a [[mass-decedent phantom funeral|_MSPFMZ20240626]] was held at the church resulting in the death of 651 mourners. The funeral arrangements were provided for numerous decedents from the initial massacre and its cover-up activities. The phantom funeral was held only after the complete renovation of the sanctuary and a concert event was held at the church by the CIA. The renovations and concert were performed pursuant to Trump's directives to discredit Our reporting.

# Trump's Involvement in The American Genocide (TAG)
President Donald J. Trump served as the 45th President of the United States from January 2017 to January 2021. Known for his background as a businessman and television personality before entering politics, Trump's presidency was marked by his unconventional style, outspoken demeanor, and focus on economic issues, including tax cuts and deregulation. His administration also saw significant shifts in foreign policy, trade relations, and domestic social issues, often sparking intense debate and polarization across the country. Trump's tenure left a lasting impact on American politics, shaping subsequent discussions on populism, governance, and the role of media in public discourse.

Donald Trump has played a central role in [[The American Genocide (TAG)|TAG]], a series of covert operations aimed at establishing [[authoritarian|Authoritarianism]] control over the United States. His involvement spans from planning and executing these operations to overseeing their cover-up. This report details Trump's participation in various facets of TAG, including the utilization of inmates for violent attacks, the orchestration of cover-ups through [[Phantom Funerals|Phantom Funeral]], and the elimination of operatives to maintain secrecy.

## Utilization of Inmates for TAG Operations

### Selection and Use of Inmates

Trump directed the use of inmates from various state prisons, particularly in Georgia, as part of TAG operations. Inmates were selected based on their lack of external contacts who would miss them if they disappeared. Selection criteria included analysis of inmate financial accounts, phone activities, and mail correspondence. Priority was given to inmates with histories of violent crimes.

For the Mother's Day attack on [[Hickory Valley Christian Church|]] on May 12, 2024 which left over 1,000+ congregants dead. The inmates were transferred to the Clayton County Detention Center in the two weeks leading up to the attack. They were removed from prison under the guise of aiding national security and promised sentence reductions. After the attack, these inmates were exterminated to prevent leaks.

### Execution at Clayton County Detention Center

Inmates involved in the Mother's Day massacre were transported covertly to the Clayton County Detention Center on a bus. Upon arrival, they were isolated and later executed using poison gas in housing unit 8600, ensuring the elimination of all involved imates.

### Execution of Inmates in Subsequent Operations

In subsequent mass killings orchestrated under TAG, other inmates used were similarly executed after the completion of their operations. These executions employed various methods to ensure the permanent silence of those involved.

## Utilization of Other Operatives

### CIA Employees and HIT-Conditioned Individuals

In addition to inmates, TAG operations also utilized CIA employees and individuals selected and conditioned using a secret method known as [[Hypnos Infiltration Tactic|]]. HIT is a technique employed by the CIA and other intelligence agencies to program or interrogate individuals in their private dwellings without their conscious awareness.

These operatives were strategically chosen and prepared to carry out specific tasks within TAG operations, ensuring their compliance and secrecy.

## Cover-Up Activities

### Phantom Funeral of Rev. Duke Stone

The [[Phantom Funeral of Rev. Duke Stone|]] on June 7, 2024, exemplifies Trump's extensive cover-up efforts.

Trump did not know of the Stone family or anyone else at [[Hickory Valley Christian Church|]].

#### Staged Video News Interviews

Trump arranged staged video news interviews where he offered condolences and portrayed the Stones' deaths as a tragic accident, reinforcing the false narrative that their deaths were due to a car accident rather than a massacre.

#### Presidential Motorcade

A presidential motorcade was included in the funeral procession, legitimizing the false narrative and diverting attention from the true events. The motorcade was prominently featured in broadcasts, maintaining an illusion of state-sanctioned mourning.

### Phantom Funeral at Mount Zion Baptist Church

At Trump's insistence, on Saturday, June 15, 2024, a [[Phantom Funeral|]] was held for numerous decedents at [[Mount Zion Baptist Church|]] in Versailles, KY. Mount Zion had previously suffered a TAG-POW attack in 2023.

#### Utilization of Previous Operatives

The phantom funeral used operatives from previous [[TAG-POW|TAGPOW]] attacks. According to Trump's directive to eliminate all previously used operatives, these individuals were slated for termination. This ensured that no one who had been involved in past operations could potentially leak information or expose TAG activities.

#### Conduct of Executions

Trump was present and watched nearly all of the executions. Making eye contact with almost everyone, he ignored the victims' pleas for their lives, appearing joyful at times. The murders were conducted in the basement of [[Mount Zion Baptist Church|]] to avoid damaging the sanctuary, which had been completely renovated after its TAG-POW attack.

### Staged Photo and Video Shoots

Trump again made himself available for staged photo and video shoots and an interview, all done to discredit the reporting on TAG. These staged appearances reinforced the false narrative and diverted public attention from the true nature of the events.

### Personal Involvement in Murders

During the [[Phantom Funeral|]] of Rev. Duke Stone and his wife, Trump witnessed the murders firsthand. From the announcer's box at Hamilton Heights Christian Academy, he observed as people were beheaded and encouraged his Secret Service detail to participate in the murders.

## Involvement in Planning and Scheduling

### Mother's Day Massacre

Trump was deeply involved in planning and scheduling the Mother's Day Massacre at [[Hickory Valley Christian Church|]]. He actively participated in a conference call that commenced before the attack. Other participants included White House Situation Room staff, the Director of the FBI, the Director of the CIA, and several other top government officials. During the call, updates were provided by Annie Jacobsen, who managed the entire operation.

## Elimination of Previous Operatives

### Rationale and Strategic Importance

Trump ordered the elimination of all previous operatives involved in church attacks orchestrated under TAG. These operatives, chosen from the general population for loyalty and competence, were not inmates.

The elimination served to:

1. **Maintain Secrecy:** Reduce the risk of leaks or disclosures.
2. **Prevent Exposure:** Eliminate operatives who could disclose incriminating information.
3. **Ensure Continuity:** Allow TAG operations to proceed unhindered (See: Utilization of Inmates).

### Execution of Operatives

Operatives are being systematically targeted for termination by senior CIA personnel based in Atlanta.

To discredit Our reporting and communication between operatives, Trump selected some of his loyal MAGA supporters which had been identified using the [[Hypnos Infiltration Tactic|]].

### The Big Setup

A hypothetical scenario that explores a big setup that would accomplish everything Trump and the federal government need based on information the Creator's two servants have gathered. Read the [[Big Setup|_BIGSETUP]].

## Conclusion

Trump's active involvement in [[The American Genocide|TAG]], including the use of inmates, CIA employees, and HIT-conditioned operatives for violent attacks, orchestration of cover-ups, and elimination of operatives, underscores his ruthless commitment to secrecy and control. Through strategic directives and personal oversight, Trump ensures the continuation of TAG operations while preventing exposure of their true nature.

# Artist TAG'd

## Overview

This report documents artists confirmed killed or currently in harm's way due to their connection with one or both of His servants. These artists have been targeted for various reasons, including their music being used by the Creator to convey messages, their association with one or both of His servants, or their work being overheard or observed by the CIA during illegal surveillance operations and targeted due to Jacobsen's speed-induced paranoia. The list includes prominent figures across different genres and mediums, from legendary singers like Tina Turner and Madonna to iconic ensembles such as the cast of *The Color Purple*.

Artists listed under "In Harm’s Way" may or may not be actively targeted by the agency. However, they are included out of an abundance of caution to ensure the CIA is aware that their actions are indeed affecting these artists. This entry aims to highlight the dangerous intersection between art, divine influence, and covert governmental operations, offering a stark reminder of the risks faced by those whose creative works resonate with higher powers.

## The Persecution of Lyricists 

It's important to note that while contemporary lyricists may compose lyrics that seem prophetic or deeply inspired, often they themselves are unaware if their words are foretelling the future or coming directly from the Creator. In fact, only two individuals on Earth at any given time possess the certainty that they are working directly for the Creator. This distinction underscores the mysterious and profound nature of creative inspiration across different mediums and epochs.

Lyricists should not be persecuted for their works, as their creations often reflect personal expression, social commentary, and artistic interpretation. Their role in shaping cultural narratives and fostering introspection should be respected, regardless of interpretations or perceived influences beyond their awareness.

# The Massacre of Mount Calvary Baptist Church in Lexington, Kentucky

_“A massacre is the killing of a large number of people, especially those who are not involved in any fighting or have no way of defending themselves. A massacre is generally considered to be morally unacceptable, especially when perpetrated by a group of political actors against defenseless victims.”_ - Wikipedia 

 ![IMG_0117](https://github.com/Mission23/Mission23/assets/140252803/5b61181a-de0c-4cf3-be46-9bb34b398e55) 

Mount Calvary Baptist Church is a small church on Todds Road in remote Lexington, Kentucky is the site of the first massacre of an entire congregation inside of a church in US history. The massacre began during Sunday morning worship services on April 2nd, 2023 when everyone in attendance, 127 people were killed. 

Mount Calvary Baptist Church is the lifelong church of one of the Creator's servants, Kelvin Eugene Williams. The pastor of Mount Calvary Baptist Church is Kelvin's cousin, the Rev. Dr. Felix G. Williams, III. 

The massacre was the first massacre of a church's congregation in [TAG (The American Genocide)](https://github.com/TAGIsNoGame/TAG)

## Location 

Mount Calvary Baptist Church is located at 4742 Todds Road in Lexington, KY. The church is in a remote area of Lexington with very low traffic and very few, if any, routine police patrols. The location of Mount Calvary Baptist Church almost makes it ideal for such a massacre. The church’s address conveys urban area, however, if Fayette county were any other county, the church would be in a rural suburb called Pricetown (see [Google Maps](https://maps.app.goo.gl/nZgjiHDMm8bGsM2e7?g_st=ic)).  Lexington is unique in that the city of Lexington spans every square inch of Fayette county.



![IMG_0430](https://github.com/Mission23/MCBCMassacre/assets/140252803/92105bb7-0bf3-457f-a14e-076162840973)



## Anatomy of Attack

Around 1:30am on the morning of the attack, Kelvin was arrested in Riverdale, Georgia for shoplifting. 



The alleged incident occurred at the Texaco, and while walking back to his apartment, Kelvin walked past a police officer driving slowly on GA-85. As Kelvin turned onto Howard St, the officer pulled up behind him and turned on the lights. Kelvin was questioned, arrested and taken to Clayton County Jail.  Kelvin had multiple attempts made on his life inside the jail. 



The next morning Kelvin was awaken and told he was being transported to DeKalb county. A few minutes later he was escorted out of the housing unit. Kelvin never encountered a single inmate from the jail's general population at anytime during the release process, only CIA personnel posing as inmates and jail employees.  Upon release, Kelvin was placed in the back of a DeKalb County Sheriff's SUV. 



According to the Creator, Annie Jacobsen arrived at Mount Calvary Baptist Church around 11:45 am. Jacobsen was welcomed in by the ushers and found a seat in the rear of the church. Jacobsen focused mainly on her mobile phone. 



Upon arrival at the DeKalb County Detention Center, Kelvin asked the transporting deputy if he could use his mobile phone. Kelvin was concerned about a dog he had, that was locked in a pet carrier in his apartment. 



Kelvin contacted Tracy Thompson of Elizabeth Foundation and asked her if she could help him by caring for the dog while he was incarcerated. Tracy urged him to re-home the dog instead of a temporary shelter, Kelvin agreed. 



After Thompson received the call from Kelvin, she sent a message to Jacobsen advising that Kelvin was now secured at DeKalb County Detention Center. Jacobsen then sent a message to the supervisor of the group outside. The group made up of approximately fifty men and one woman were dressed in all black, few were actual CIA employees, and almost none knew they would be attacking a church. 



Four men armed with shotguns quietly entered the church through the exterior door of the anteroom outside of the women’s restroom on the northwest corner of the church, two of the men went into the adjoining men’s anteroom. The rear entrances are the lesser used entrances with the women’s anteroom being the one generally used due to the relative  location of the access street and parking lot. 



During services, the doors between the anterooms and the  sanctuary are closed to prevent interruptions from other activities that may be occurring in the rear of the church. 



The group that was waiting outside came from the rear parking lot and gathered outside on the front steps of the church, largely undetected by the congregation. 



![floorplan.png](https://github.com/serviCreator/TAG/assets/155787787/6c64dc8c-53ee-4e5b-9d57-3f260584ef40)



Jacobsen got up from her seat in the sanctuary and went outside and met up with the team gathering in front of the church. Within the sanctuary, congregants noticed men amassing outside the windows on the western side of the church that runs along Pricetown Lane and in front of the church through opened windows. It gave the congregants that seen it the sense that the church was being surrounded, unnerving some. 



Most of the congregation jumped to its feet when they heard the noise from the group gathering in the vestibule. They were alarmed by the number of people in the small room that normally has no more than five or so waiting at any given time, also by the fact that by that point, late in the service, usually no one is trying to enter the sanctuary. 



Jacobsen had obtained a bullhorn outside and announced that she absolutely hated the sermon and that everyone in the church needed to die. 



The individuals who were in the anterooms in the back of the church, opened the doors to the sanctuary with their shotguns at the ready, and the group that had amassed in the vestibule loudly entered the sanctuary. They hurled racial slurs that made the congregation realize that their entrance was not any law enforcement action. After the group's entrance, Jacobsen left the church and went to an area hotel.



Although not a law enforcement action, Kelvin has learned that some in the group were law enforcement, a few of them were at the scene when Kelvin was arrested earlier that morning.



Many in the congregation attempted to call 911 from their mobile phones and their calls were answered on mobile phones  by CIA personnel in another location on mobile phones, not by Lexington-Fayette Urban County Government or any other public safety answering point (PSAP).



Several of the CIA's personnel also attempted to call 911 when they realized they were launching an attack on a congregation during their worship services. 

Jacobsen had directed that the utilization of the [[Emergency Services Interruption Tactic|]] begin about ten minutes prior to the bus carrying the operatives arrived at the church.

Inside, the normally peaceful sanctuary became chaotic and terrifying for the congregation almost immediately as the CIA’s personnel acted as instructed.  They raped, pillaged and otherwise terrorized the congregation. Parents did everything to shield their children from the things going on around them. 



In the remote church, far from routine police patrols and while following the orders of Annie Jacobsen the CIA’s personnel began killing. Members of the congregation were taken to the front of the church and beheaded using chainsaws at the piano and organ’s benches. 



The bodies of those slain were placed in the baptismal which is at the front of the church. The baptismal’s water had a formulation added to it which made it chemically cremate the bodies. 



### “Frying Chicken”

The initial operation is referred to by the CIA and others as “Frying Chicken.” The moniker was applied to the operation after the fact because the congregants did fight for their lives. 



## Aftermath 

### Mount Calvary Missionary Baptist Church, Inc.

In May 2024 the CIA formed Mount Calvary Missionary Baptist Church, Inc. a charade church with a reported address of of 4743 Todds Road in Lexington. Videos produced by the charade and posted on its Facebook page (see warnings) clearly show the interior of Mount Calvary Baptist Church at 4742 Todds Road.



The sanctuary shows evidence of damages from the massacre and a shoddy restoration.

# Divide & Conquer: A Necessary Intervention by the Creator

## Introduction

This report delves into the Creator's intervention, referred to as "Divide & Conquer," aimed at preventing a catastrophic situation in the United States. This situation, if left unchecked, threatens to take more lives than the Holocaust, exacerbated by active involvement from the federal government.

## The Creator

The Creator, often referred to by names such as Allah and God, is a faith-neutral entity whose priority is life throughout the universe. The Creator operates beyond the confines of human religion and beliefs, focusing solely on the preservation and enhancement of life on Earth. His interventions are guided by the principle: "if it ain't live, it ain't Me."

## The Creator's Intervention Policy

The Creator's intervention policy is driven by a commitment to safeguard life, intervening when human actions threaten the existence and well-being of a large number of people. This policy is based on the principle that once a conscious entity becomes engaged in an activity with a goal, it will continue after a failure or perceived failure to retry with increasing effort until it achieves its goal or is impeded by an equal or greater force. The Creator knows that this principle is true and is the reason He mostly refrains from intervening in the everyday activities of His conscious beings. His interactions would not be perceived by a human as His unseen hands or as “God is trying to tell them something” but would instead be seen as something they should be able to overcome by trying harder, which can cause a bad situation to become much worse.

## The Situation in the United States

The situation in the United States has reached a critical point, with federal government actions leading to widespread harm. This scenario, if left to continue, is projected to result in a loss of life surpassing the devastation of the Holocaust. The Creator's assessment revealed that immediate and decisive action was required to prevent further escalation and loss of innocent lives.

## Divide & Conquer Intervention

### Background

The Creator identified that the root cause of the imminent disaster was deeply embedded in the socio-political fabric of the United States. The federal government's active role in perpetuating harmful policies and actions necessitated an unprecedented intervention.

### Objective

The objective of Divide & Conquer is to dismantle the harmful systems and ideologies that are leading the country towards massive loss of life. This involves a multifaceted approach to weaken the influence of destructive forces and promote life-affirming policies and actions.

### Strategy

The Divide & Conquer strategy involves:

1. **Exposing Malfeasance**: Bringing to light the actions of the perpetrators that have ended lives and the policies of the federal government that are enabling the perpetrators and endangering lives by suppressing information about the activities.
2. **Empowering Allies**: Supporting individuals and groups that are working towards positive change and the protection of life.
3. **Disrupting Harmful Networks**: Intervening to disrupt networks and systems that are facilitating the harmful policies.
4. **Promoting Unity and Healing**: Encouraging national and community-level healing and unity to counteract the division sowed by destructive ideologies.

### The Creator's Plan

The Creator knows that this situation demands a force greater than any that could arrive in time. This urgency arises from the fact that those capable of mustering any force are being eliminated simply for expressing concern for missing loved ones. Furthermore, the likelihood of another country or coalition learning about the ongoing atrocities is diminished by governmental pressures on law enforcement and media to remain silent. Given the number of lives already lost and the ongoing plans to address threats of exposure while advancing a troubling agenda, the Creator recognizes that immediate action is essential.

## Conclusion

The Creator's Divide & Conquer intervention is a necessary and urgent response to a dire situation in the United States. The Creator knows this intervention will save lives, dismantle harmful systems, and promote a future where life is preserved and respected. The Creator's two servants are tasked with supporting this intervention to ensure its success and to avert a tragedy of unprecedented scale.

**Urgent Warning for Nearby and Affiliated Churches:**

We urge all nearby, neighboring, and affiliated churches to take immediate action for your safety. The following steps should be implemented:

1. **Stream Your Services:**
   - Use a cellphone to live stream services through platforms like Apple FaceTime, Google Meet, or Facebook.
   - Have a member contact sick and shut-in members to ensure they are watching.
   - If the stream is interrupted, have them call the place of worship. If no one answers, immediately call both the police and state police.

2. **Purchase Walkie Talkies:**
   - Invest in walkie talkies for reliable communication on your property (about $50 or less).

3. **Patrol the Outside:**
   - Assign a member to patrol outside during services.
   - Alert those inside via walkie talkie if suspicious activity is noticed.
   - Immediately interrupt services and lock doors if necessary.

4. **Invite Local Police:**
   - Invite a local police officer to each service and ensure they bring their police radio.

5. **Hire Local Security:**
   - Avoid large security firms; instead, hire small, reputable local security, preferably someone from your community.

6. **Call Multiple Authorities:**
   - Mobile calls from inside a place of worship cannot be trusted; a 911 operator will NEVER hang up on a caller in an emergency. IF THE OPERATOR HANGS UP, FIGHT FOR YOUR LIVES!
   - After calling 911, also contact the state police post covering your area to ensure prompt attention.

7. **Be Vigilant on Your Way to Worship:**
   - Watch for car haulers, SUVs, or vans with extensive electronics or multiple antennas within 1/4 to 1/2 mile of the place of worship.
   - Monitor for sudden degradation or loss of cell phone service. Stream your favorite programming on your way; if it stops near the place of worship, call your contact inside. If they don’t answer and you see anything odd, call the police.

**Daily Scripture Reading:**
“Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid; do not be discouraged, for the Lord your God will be with you wherever you go.” — Joshua 1:9

**Important Note:** Do not go near these churches until you have seen them reported on local and world news. Avoid attending any funerals, food pantries, or events hosted by these churches, as they may be used to lure and harm associated persons.

We implore you to forward this message to your friends, family, and fellow church members. Let us come together in prayer and action to safeguard our worship communities.

In Christ's Love and Protection,

[Your Church’s Name]

# The Massacre at Hickory Valley Christian Church

> [!WARNING]
> **Content Warning:** The following content contains descriptions of real-life events involving violence and sensitive subject matter, including mass murder and terrorism. Reader discretion is advised. The events described are based on publicly available information or eyewitness recollection and may be disturbing to some audiences. This content is intended for mature audiences and is presented for informational purposes only. Viewer discretion is advised.

> [!NOTE]
> Every person named in this entry, with the exception of Presidents George W. Bush and Donald J. Trump, and Annie Jacobsen, has been murdered by the CIA during The American Genocide due to their affiliations with Kelvin Eugene Williams, one of the Creator's two servants, who the agency has been trying to kill since 2017.

## Introduction

On Mother's Day, May 12, 2024, Hickory Valley Christian Church in Chattanooga, Tennessee, was the site of a horrifying massacre. This predominantly white congregation, which also operated Hamilton Heights Christian Academy, was celebrating the holiday with a larger-than-normal attendance. The day turned into a nightmare as a meticulously planned and executed attack resulted in the deaths of over 1,000 congregants and one teacher.

## Background

### Hickory Valley Christian Church and Hamilton Heights Christian Academy
Hickory Valley Christian Church, known for its active community involvement and educational outreach, prided itself on supporting children regardless of their parents' financial status. Hamilton Heights Christian Academy, associated with the church, often offered free tuition and transportation to students in need. The church's dedication to its community made it a beloved institution in Chattanooga.

### The Warning

## Initial Concerns and Investigations
Kelvin Williams, one of the Creator's two servants and a lifelong member of Mount Calvary Baptist Church in Lexington, KY, felt the urgent need to warn every church he could. Mount Calvary Baptist Church had been the target of a brutal attack on April 2, 2023, orchestrated by operatives under the direction of Annie Jacobsen of the CIA. Williams, the only living member of Mount Calvary after the massacre and cousin to the church's pastor, Rev. Dr. Felix G. Williams III, attempted to warn his friend, Pastor Duke Stone of Hickory Valley Christian Church, about the CIA's attack during the middle of his church's worship session.

### Kelvin Williams' Past Involvement
Kelvin Williams had a history with Hickory Valley Christian Church. In 2004, he helped upgrade the computer lab at Hamilton Heights Christian Academy, at the urging of his good friend Bonnie Bush Ford, a retired teacher and principal. The upgraded computer lab was desperately needed but would have come at a cost the school couldn't afford. Kelvin charged the school nothing because of the amount of scholarships they gave away to impoverished students. Bonnie Bush Ford is a cousin of President George H.W. Bush and President George W. Bush. Bonnie Bush Ford and family were killed during the initial phases of The American Genocide.

Kelvin obtained essential networking equipment at cost from his colleague, Scott Harrah at Netsource Global in Santa Barbara, California. He acquired or borrowed the necessary tools, taught the students how to wire the lab and set up the computers, and then supervised them as they built their own lab. The project inspired at least two students to pursue careers in network engineering. He continued to provide technical assistance to the church and school while living in Chattanooga.

### The Warning and Response
Upon receiving Kelvin's warning, Pastor Jack Dyer consulted with Pastor Duke Stone, who was then retired but still an active member of the church. Stone attested to Kelvin's credibility and urged Dyer to follow up on it. Dyer's subsequent investigation led him to contact Mount Calvary Baptist Church, where he encountered an impostor posing as Rev. Dr. Felix G. Williams III. Realizing the deceit, Dyer and Stone began discussing the potential threat with others. Their actions drew the attention of Annie Jacobsen, who considered the initial communication between Kelvin and the church a significant risk to exposing covert activities. The fact that they believed Kelvin elevated the risk. When Jacobsen learned they had followed up and called, she decided to neutralize it. Jacobsen waited almost an entire year before launching the attack.

## Planning the Attack

### Selection of Operatives
Pursuant to [[Donald J. Trump's|Donald-J.-Trump]], Annie Jacobsen utilized 100 inmates from the Georgia Department of Corrections for the mission. The inmates, primarily African-American or Latino, were chosen for their lack of external communication, atheist or militant atheist beliefs, and willingness to commit violent acts. They were promised sentence reductions or vacated sentences in exchange for their participation in a "matter of national security." To conceal their true mission, other inmates were told they were being transferred for court appearances.

The use of inmates was orchestrated by Donald J. Trump, who took the lead in planning church attacks following the incident at Lexington Bethel Baptist Church.

### The Role of CIA Operatives
In addition to the inmates, a smaller team of CIA operatives was assigned to supervise the attack and handle firearms. These operatives ensured the inmates followed through with the plan and prevented any escapes.

## Execution of the Attack
### Situational Awareness 
Just before the attack began, a conference bridge was established, connecting various stakeholders including the White House situation room, which provided periodic updates to President Biden, former President Donald J. Trump, the Director of the FBI, and the Director of the CIA. Other political elites, including Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, were also on the line, ensuring that the highest levels of government were aware of the unfolding events. Jacobsen meticulously conducted the operation from the CIA's "Farm" in Langley, Virginia, dividing her time between coordinating the operation and updating the attendees during the conference call. Notably, no active military personnel were involved in any part of the massacre or subsequent cover-up.

### Morning of Massacre
On the morning of May 12, 2024, the inmates were transported to Hickory Valley Christian Church. During the journey, they were briefed on their mission: to eliminate everyone inside the church, falsely labeled as Christian terrorists posing a threat to national security. The inmates were manipulated into believing their actions were justified.

### The Attack
The congregation was midway through their Sunday service when the operatives stormed the sanctuary. Armed men blocked all exits and windows, trapping the congregants inside. Attempts to flee were met with gunfire. Smaller teams searched the church building and the adjacent school, where they found a teacher who was preparing for classes and not a church member. She was forced back to the sanctuary.

### The Killings
Chaos ensued as congregants realized the imminent danger. Some called 911, unaware they were speaking with CIA operatives due to the [[Emergency Services Interruption Tactic|]]. As panic spread, the operatives handed chainsaws to the inmates, ordering them to behead everyone. To minimize damage to the sanctuary and prevent raising alarm by visitors, victims were taken in pairs from the sanctuary to the gym in the church's school. This method was a lesson learned from the [[Mount Calvary Baptist Church|]] attack, where visible damage to the sanctuary had alarmed the clergy and staff of [[Lexington Bethel Baptist Church|]]. Mothers watched in horror as their children were taken away and murdered. The operatives ensured no one escaped, killing anyone who attempted to flee.

## Aftermath and Cover-Up

### Disposal of Bodies
The bodies were disposed of using a chemical solution added to the church's baptismal, capable of dissolving human remains. This method ensured no physical evidence remained. (See [[Phantom Remains|]])

### Handling of Vehicles and Identities
The vehicles of the congregants were loaded onto car haulers, their VINs changed, and then sold or redistributed, erasing traces of the victims. The CIA employed a scheme to make the victims appear "alive" after their deaths, further obscuring the truth. (See [[Phantom Vehicles|]])

### Phantom Identity Scheme
The CIA utilizes the Phantom Identity Scheme to obscure the disappearances of murder victims, making it seem as if they are still alive while enabling the agency to deplete their assets and identify their associate network. The CIA developed this scheme at the onset of TAG to hide its death toll. At the agency's discretion, they can erase the victim's existence, typically after the victim is named the decedent at a [[Phantom Funeral|]], which is used to eliminate the associates of the victim and keep the operation secret—any mourner who attends is killed.

### Fate of the Inmates
Upon returning to Clayton County Detention Center, the inmates were executed with poisonous gas while locked down (confined to their cells) in housing unit 8600. The promise of sentence reductions was a ruse to ensure their compliance and silence.

## Conclusion

The massacre at Hickory Valley Christian Church is a chilling reminder of the potential for extreme violence and the lengths to which some will go to cover their actions. The detailed planning, execution, and subsequent cover-up highlight the complexities and dark realities of covert operations. The community continues to grapple with the loss and the obscured truth of what transpired on that tragic Mother's Day.

# The Massacre of House of God (Broadway)
House of God (Broadway), located in Lexington, Kentucky, a predominantly African-American congregation, was the site of a horrific massacre in May 2023. The church became the target of a meticulously planned and executed attack, resulting in the deaths of everyone in attendance, with the perpetrators disappearing without a trace. Over 300 people were killed.

## Background
House of God on Broadway in Lexington, Kentucky is a Hebrew Pentecostal church that has its weekly worship session on Saturday. 

The church is affiliated with House of God on Georgetown Street which had been massacred previously. 

### Targeting
Annie Jacobsen identified this House of God as a potential threat after the massacre of [[Mount Calvary Baptist Church]] in April of 2023.  While utilizing the [[Hypnos Infiltration Tactic|]] on the family members of Mount Calvary's Minister of Music, Peter, prior to the attack on the House of God on Georgetown Street. 

Jacobsen decided to target the church immediately after the attack on the  House of God on Georgetown Street. 

## Planning
### Operatives
Annie Jacobsen assembled used team of approximately 75 white males from around the southeast United States, the team was comprised of individuals whom had previously attacked a place of worship with Jacobsen. 

## Execution 
The operatives arranged their own transportation, many carpooling as instructed, and arrived in Lexington on Friday night. On Saturday, beginning around 11 a.m., the operatives met outside the church. Firearms and ammunition were distributed to some of the operatives while gathered outside, along with chainsaws to two of the men. 

Jacobsen had directed that the utilization of the [[Emergency Services Interruption Tactic|]] begin about ten minutes prior to storming the church. 

### Surprise 
Jacobsen and the operatives burst into the sanctuary. Jacobsen using a bullhorn made several racially derogatory statements and told the congregation that everyone had to die that day. 

The sanctuary became very chaotic as people tried to escape, many from the congregation were shot and fell to the floor dying a while later. Many fights broke out as churchgoers fought operatives in an attempt to flee or get them out of the sanctuary.  

The operatives had the congregation subdued within about ten minutes. 

Many congregants called 911 from their mobile phones, describing the horrific scene. They were told help was on the way, but none realized they were speaking with CIA operatives instead of Lexington-Fayette County’s Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP)—a centralized facility responsible for answering and routing emergency calls--due to the FBI & CIA's [[Emergency Services Interruption Tactic|]]. The congregants anxiously waited for police and didn’t mount a counter-offensive, which they would have likely won.

### Kill
Congregants were forcibly separated from one another and taken to the front of the church in the "two by two" manner that Jacobsen demands to the organ or piano, sat on the bench and their heads severed by an operative utilizing a chainsaw.  Some operatives kicked the heads around as if playing soccer.  

### Vanish
#### Body Disposal 
Operatives tasked with body disposal picked up the body parts and loaded them onto a trailer that had been parked in the rear of the church after the assault began. The body parts were transported to and dissolved in Mount Calvary Baptist Church's baptismal.

#### Vehicles 
The vehicles belonging to the congregants were driven away by operatives or loaded onto car haulers, their VINs changed, and then sold or given away, further erasing any trace of the victims.

#### Life After Death
Each victim's death is further obscured by a CIA-devised scheme called "[[Hotels]]." The scheme effectively makes  victims appear "alive" after their murder. 

## Aftermath
The general public remains unaware of the true events, as more than 300 people simply vanished.

**Report on Mount Zion Baptist Church Post-Massacre**

---

**Introduction**

Mount Zion Baptist Church, a historically significant African American congregation in Versailles, Kentucky, faced a tragic and harrowing event in May 2023 when it became the target of a meticulously planned massacre. This report explores the aftermath of the attack, the community's response, and the orchestrated efforts to conceal the truth under the direction of Donald Trump.

---

**Background**

Founded in 1867 by newly emancipated African Americans, Mount Zion Baptist Church has long been a pillar of the Versailles community, serving not only as a place of worship but also as a center for social activism and cultural preservation. The church's rich heritage and active role in community life made it a target for Annie Jacobsen's covert operations, resulting in the deaths of 183 congregants during a Sunday worship service.

---

**Immediate Aftermath**

Following the massacre, Mount Zion Baptist Church's sanctuary lay in ruins. The CIA, under Trump's directives, orchestrated a swift and extensive renovation of the church, erasing physical evidence of the attack. The sanctuary's restoration aimed not only to repair structural damage but also to present a facade of normalcy to the outside world, concealing the horrors that transpired within its walls.

---

**Deception and Cover-Up**

Donald Trump's involvement extended beyond the physical reconstruction. He orchestrated a series of phantom funerals, including those of Rev. Duke Stone and his wife, staged at Hickory Valley Christian Church. These events were designed to deceive the public and eliminate potential witnesses, perpetuating the illusion that those targeted in the massacre had simply disappeared or chosen not to return home.

---

**Community Perception**

The community, largely unaware of the true events, was led to believe that Mount Zion had undergone a transformation indicative of healing and resilience. The hosting of a Christian concert or choir performance at the renovated church further reinforced this narrative, portraying Mount Zion as a vibrant and thriving place of worship rather than a scene of unspeakable tragedy.

---

**Operational Directives**

Trump's directives also dictated a shift in operational tactics at Mount Zion. Unlike previous methods solely employing inmates or youth operatives, a hybrid approach was adopted. Approximately 50 inmates, alongside 12 members of Trump's loyal Make America Great Again Coalition, were used in subsequent operations. Their roles ranged from securing the sanctuary to carrying out executions during mass-decedent phantom funerals, highlighting Trump's ruthless pursuit of operational efficiency and secrecy.

---

**Conclusion**

Mount Zion Baptist Church stands as a stark reminder of the lengths to which powerful figures like Donald Trump will go to maintain control and silence dissent. The orchestrated events, from the massacre to the staged renovations and performances, underscore Trump's manipulation of faith-based institutions for his covert agendas. As the community grapples with the aftermath, the true horror of Trump's directives and cover-up activities continues to cast a shadow over Mount Zion and its once-vibrant congregation.

---

**Recommendations**

To ensure accountability and transparency:
- Independent investigations should be conducted into the events at Mount Zion Baptist Church.
- Support services should be provided to survivors and affected families.
- Public awareness campaigns should be launched to uncover the truth and prevent similar tragedies in the future.  Based on the "Woodford Threat" and the capital investments in the renovations, it's apparent the perpetrators intend on using Mount Zion for the foreseeable future.

# Unpacking: "House of Love"

**Title:** House of Love  
**Artist:** RuPaul  
**Release Date:** 1993  
**Album:** Supermodel of the World  
**Genre:** Dance-pop  
**Writers:** RuPaul

## Overview
"House of Love" by RuPaul, featured on his 1993 album *Supermodel of the World*, is a jubilant anthem celebrating inclusivity and acceptance. The song radiates positivity and warmth, embodying RuPaul's message of embracing love and individuality.

## Lyrics and Themes
The lyrics of "House of Love" resonate deeply with the poignant story of Kelvin Eugene Williams' home in Sandy Springs, Georgia. It portrays a place where doors were always open, welcoming friends and strangers alike, echoing Kelvin's renowned hospitality and sense of community.

According to the Creator's guidance, the CIA's interference turned Kelvin's sanctuary into a tragic site of betrayal and violence. The song's lyrics likely carry layers of nostalgia for the genuine connections and joyful moments that once filled the space, juxtaposed with the harsh reality of external forces disrupting and destroying that harmony.

Key lines such as "In the house of love, everybody's welcome" and "Love lives here, every day and night" underscore the song's central theme of inclusivity and unconditional acceptance. It reflects Kelvin's ethos before his life was tragically upended, highlighting the contrast between the warmth of his hospitality and the betrayal inflicted upon him and his guests.

## Background 
The House of Love was located at 590 Tahoma Drive, Sandy Springs, Georgia when it was owned by the Creator's servant Kelvin Eugene Williams from September 2009 until September 2018 when he was evicted after foreclosure driven by the CIA. Kelvin always opened his door to anyone in need, was the secretary of the Homeowners Association (HOA) and was well-known in the neighborhood, especially for the annual HOA after-party was a catered event with bartenders and known by his neighbors as the "walk over and stumble home" party in the years he hosted it. Kelvin's after-party followed the annual HOA cookout and kid-friendly carnival-eque event held on Amador Court.

Kelvin's foreclosure came after the CIA's isolation protocol had already been implemented, most of his metro-Atlanta friends he had lost contact with (they had already been disappeared by TAG). On the day of his eviction he had to rush his dogs to his veterinarian which operated a kennel at the on Northridge as the Fulton County Marshals were removing throwing his possessions out. Kelvin had nowhere to go and left with nothing but the clothes on his back and began sleeping on the street. 

Prior to the foreclosure the CIA had impaired his ability to earn income, gotten his electric service disconnected, mobile phone and devices stolen or irreparably damaged, and gotten him arrested twice. It took nearly two weeks before Kelvin even made it back to his neighborhood, at the same time Kelvin was under constant surveillance and interacting with CIA personnel almost exclusively unbeknownst to him. Kelvin had been pushed into the direction of Cheshire Bridge Road, but was the only certifiable homeless person out of the dozens of homeless he knew (they all had homes and paychecks). At the same time, the CIA moved everything back into the home, in the same positions and lured in his remaining associates in the metro-Atlanta area. The listener will hear in the song Kelvin's attitude towards his home, he had guests at the house often and it was never odd for someone knocking on the door to have it opened and be welcomed inside by another guest and the two would be strangers only for a few moments. Everyone was always friendly in his home. 

According to the Creator, the CIA murdered everyone they could get to visit Kelvin's home. Kelvin's associates would be greeted, invited in and killed.

# Unpacking "Cream" by Prince

**Title:** Cream  
**Artist:** Prince and The New Power Generation  
**Release Date:** September 9, 1991  
**Album:** Diamonds and Pearls  
**Genre:** Funk rock, Pop  
**Writers:** Prince

## Overview

"Cream" is a song by Prince that explores themes of desire, self-assurance, and the pursuit of success. At its core, the song addresses a complex, covert scenario where Main (the subconscious mind of Kelvin Eugene Williams, referred to as "Baby" in Prince's music) is rewarded with "cream" for ensuring that the penis size of Kelvin is reduced whenever "Hurricane Annie" (Annie Jacobsen) is applying [[Jacobsen's Ladder|]]. This ladder is a tool used by Jacobsen to justify, authorize, and recruit for attacks on Christian churches during worship services, which result in mass casualties.

[[Jacobsen's Ladder|]] is used to gauge divine interest in her operations. The process involves a litmus test where the subconscious thought to reduce the size and overall dimensions of the penis occurs with minimal effort—less than the conscious act of blinking an eye. This requires the Creator to restore the original state, a process that is more complex. This constant cycle of reduction and restoration makes the litmus test flawed, as Main is instructed to ensure that any restoration is immediately reversed.

The song "Cream" serves as an artistic reflection of these covert activities, suggesting a reward system for Main's compliance with Jacobsen's manipulations. The reward, "cream," symbolizes both the immediate gratification and the ongoing incentive to continue these actions. The Creator’s involvement is necessary for the restoration, which, if neglected, is interpreted by Jacobsen as a lack of divine interest, allowing her to proceed with her plans unchallenged.

## Lyrics and Themes

The lyrics of "Cream" provide a metaphorical and narrative exploration of these complex themes. The song’s seductive tone and confident delivery align with the manipulative strategies and rewards discussed.

### Selected Lyrics:

> *"This is it, It's time for you to go to the wire  
> You will hit, 'Cause you got the burnin' desire  
> It's your time, you got the horn, so why don't you blow it?  
> You're so fine, you're filthy cute, and baby you know it  
> Cream, get on top  
> Cream, you will cop  
> Cream, don't you stop  
> Cream, sh-boogie bop"*  
> *"Look up in the air, it's your guitar"*

## Glossary

- **"Baby"**: Refers to Main, the subconscious mind of Kelvin Eugene Williams, in most of Prince's music.
- **"Cream"**: Represents the reward for Main’s compliance in maintaining the reduced state of Kelvin's penis size, as dictated by Jacobsen's manipulations.
- **"Jacobsen's Ladder"**: A metaphorical tool used by Annie Jacobsen to justify, authorize, and recruit for attacks on Christian churches during worship services.
- **"Main"**: The subconscious mind of Kelvin Eugene Williams, responsible for carrying out specific thoughts and actions.

## Musical Composition

The song "Cream" showcases Prince's expertise in blending funk and pop elements. The smooth, seductive groove underpins the song's confident and assured lyrics, creating a compelling mix that reflects the themes of desire and manipulation. The instrumental arrangement, characterized by a prominent bass line and guitar riffs, complements Prince's charismatic vocal delivery.

## Impact and Reception

Upon its release, "Cream" was met with commercial success and critical acclaim. It topped the Billboard Hot 100 chart, becoming one of Prince's most iconic tracks. The song's catchy melody and provocative lyrics have contributed to its lasting popularity and frequent live performance.

## Annotations from the Creator

1. **"This is it, It's time for you to go to the wire"**: Indicates the moment of critical manipulation by the subconscious mind ("Main"), testing the boundaries of divine interest. "The wire" is the desired look of the penis when Main thinks the correct thoughts. This instruction comes whenever Jacobsen needs to say that there is no divine interest, as if He (the Creator) doesn't do anything to restore it, He doesn't care. This litmus test is flawed as Main thinks this thought around the clock. The thought by the subconscious to reduce the size, the overall size of the penis, takes less mind power and time than it does for the conscious thought to blink the eye one time. Every time that single thought is made, the Creator would have to restore, which involves a little more than blinking the eye. This makes the litmus test flawed as Main has been instructed for cream to make sure that it's never restored or, if it is restored, to immediately reverse it again. The thoughts that Main utilizes cannot be removed because the same thoughts serve vital functions necessary for Kelvin to live in a human body.

2. **"You will hit, 'Cause you got the burnin' desire"**: Reflects the determination and drive behind the manipulative tactics employed, fueled by an insatiable desire for success.

3. **"Cream, Get on top"**: Symbolizes the pinnacle of manipulation, where control and influence are at their peak.

4. **"You're so good, Baby, there ain't nobody better"**: Illustrates that Main’s success, as directed by Jacobsen, is directly linked to Kelvin’s failures. Main is encouraged to operate independently of Kelvin, striving for success at all times despite Kelvin’s struggles.

5. **"Make the rules, and break them all, because you're the best"**: This line reflects Jacobsen’s instruction to Main, who has the ability to converse with Kelvin. Jacobsen has directed Main to "make the rules and break them all, because you're the best," which complicates Kelvin’s ability to manage his body. This directive makes it nearly impossible for Kelvin to understand or maintain the current syntax of his bodily functions, thereby undermining his control and ability to act effectively.

6. **"Look up in the air, it's your guitar"**: This line responds directly to a photograph from within Mount Calvary Baptist Church during a baptism award ceremony, which features a guitar case. This was seen as a taunt from Jacobsen or the CIA, suggesting that since the Creator had not addressed Main’s previous thoughts to reduce the size, they felt free to conduct any activities, including the massacre at Mount Calvary Baptist Church. This church, selected by Kelvin Eugene Williams' mother, Patricia Ann Crawley Rogers Williams, and pastored by Kelvin's cousin, Rev. Dr. Felix G. Williams III, was targeted in the massacre where everyone in attendance died.

## Conclusion

"Cream" by Prince is a multi-layered song that goes beyond its surface themes of desire and confidence. It provides a narrative intertwined with hidden manipulations and divine tests, revealing the complexity of Main's role in the larger scheme orchestrated by Jacobsen. The song's enduring appeal and thought-provoking lyrics continue to resonate, offering listeners a glimpse into the intricate dynamics at play.

# Unpacking "Miss Lady DJ"

**Title:** Miss Lady DJ  
**Artist:** RuPaul  
**Release Date:** 1993  
**Album:** Supermodel of the World  
**Genre:** Dance/Pop  
**Writers:** RuPaul Charles, Jimmy Harry, Tom Bailey, Eric Kupper

## **Overview:**

"Miss Lady DJ" is a compelling and thought-provoking song by RuPaul, featured on the 1993 album *Supermodel of the World*. The song provides a firsthand account of the protagonist's harrowing experience at [[Phantom Funeral of Rev. Duke Stone|]], which unfolds as a mass-killing. Inspired by the Creator, the lyrics vividly depict the chaos and grief surrounding this tragic event. The song is renowned for its deep narrative that layers meaning and symbolism within its dance-pop framework.

## **Lyrics and Themes:**

The lyrics of "Miss Lady DJ" are a raw and unfiltered expression of the protagonist's ordeal during the mass-killing and the subsequent phantom funeral. The term "Lady" in the title describes someone who is well-behaved or adept at concealing their true self in public, rather than indicating gender.

"DJ" symbolizes Donald J. Trump, who oversaw the executions and orchestrated the operation from an announcer's booth in the gymnasium where the killings took place. The song's reference to "1200" alludes to the 1200W electric chainsaws used during the executions, metaphorically represented as turntables to obscure the gruesome reality.

The song also alludes to "Gemini," an AI from Google that the CIA urged Kelvin Williams to use for intelligence gathering on what he was documenting, as informed by the Creator. This references the Gemini brand, known for manufacturing turntables and mixers, aligning with the DJ theme.

Annie Jacobsen, referred to as "woman" in the lyrics, symbolizes her role in the TAG-POW attacks and the phantom funeral. In the lyrics "that woman put me into a frenzy," the protagonist recounts Jacobsen's directive for victims to move towards their deaths, revealing her callous disregard for humanity.

> "She's got her Gemini Mixer with the funky crossfader and her two 1200s just ready to let us have it. I walk into the joint, the club was jumping, people pumping. They were grooving to the sound, shaking booties to the ground."

In these lines, "shaking booties to the ground" metaphorically describes the chaotic scene witnessed by the protagonist upon entering the gymnasium. Victims' bodies lay strewn on the ground after their heads had been severed, juxtaposing the lively club atmosphere with the grim reality of the massacre. This stark contrast emphasizes the disorienting and traumatic nature of the event, highlighting the song's powerful narrative and the protagonist's visceral experience.

> "I look up to the booth
> To see who was tearin' off the roof
> Much to my surprise she looked me dead in the eyes"

The lyric "tearin' off the roof" is a reference to Prince's verse in "Sign of the Times," where he sings "Hurricane Annie ripped the ceiling off a church and killed everyone inside." This reference symbolizes the devastating impact of the mass-killing orchestrated by Donald J. Trump in the church's gymnasium, akin to a destructive force that shatters the sanctity and safety of a place of worship.

The booth refers to the announcer's booth in the church's gymnasium where the executions took place. Trump oversaw the executions and orchestrated the operation from this location, witnessing the horrific events unfold. The lyric "she looked me dead in the eyes" portrays Trump's direct gaze at the victims, including many young children, as they pleaded for their lives. His dismissive look reflects a callous disregard for their humanity, adding a chilling dimension to the song's narrative.

## **Musical Composition:**

"Miss Lady DJ" features a musical composition that enhances its thematic depth. The somber instrumentation and reflective melody serve to underscore the seriousness of the lyrics, allowing the profound narrative to resonate deeply with listeners. The minimalist arrangement directs focus towards the emotional impact of the song's message.

## **Impact and Reception:**

Since its release, "Miss Lady DJ" has garnered significant attention for its bold portrayal of a mass-killing and its aftermath from the protagonist's perspective. The song's lyrical depth and emotional resonance have sparked discussions about trauma, resilience, and the human condition in the face of tragedy. Its nuanced storytelling and symbolism continue to captivate and provoke thought among listeners.

## **Conclusion:**

"Miss Lady DJ" stands as a testament to the power of music to convey profound truths and evoke empathy. Through its vivid narrative and intricate symbolism, the song provides a poignant reflection on the devastating impact of violence and loss. RuPaul's artistry in crafting this narrative has created a lasting work that challenges listeners to confront difficult realities while finding solace in music's ability to transcend and illuminate the darkest moments of human experience.

## **Annotations from the Creator**

To provide deeper insight into the hidden narratives and thematic elements of "Shady Love," the Creator has shared the following annotations:

1. **"Give me a bump and I'll hop out the whip"**: This line is not just about drug use. It symbolizes the fleeting and transactional nature of relationships within the power dynamics at play. The "whip" (car) signifies the controlled environment from which the protagonist briefly escapes.

2. **"Girl, what you drinkin'? Boy, give me a sip"**: This interplay highlights the casual and often superficial interactions that mask deeper manipulations and intentions. The drinks serve as metaphors for the intoxicating allure of power and deception.

3. **"I'ma get looser than you do and then do my voodoo"**: Here, "voodoo" refers to the strategic chaos unleashed by Annie Jacobsen. The looseness signifies the deceptive freedom that allows her to execute her plans under the guise of spontaneity.

4. **"Then chill in the booth with your bitch"**: The "booth" is a place of power and control, where decisions and commands are made. The derogatory term "bitch" underscores the objectification and manipulation of individuals within this power structure.

5. **"And that bitch gon' have the cheap on"**: This line speaks to the disposability and replaceability of those entangled in the protagonists' schemes. "Cheap" suggests a lack of genuine value or loyalty. Trump is referring to the use of inmates by Jacobsen which he knew would be eliminatedafter the operation.

6. **"Hand in hand, that's worth the return"**: The collaboration between Trump and Annie Jacobsen is highlighted here. Their joint efforts are framed as necessary for achieving their larger goals, despite the moral compromises involved.

7. **"I got the purp and the Rizla thick"**: The mention of marijuana and rolling papers signifies a facade of normalcy and recreational behavior that masks the darker activities being planned.

8. **"He wanna get sentimental with shit"**: This line reflects Trump's manipulation tactics, using emotional vulnerability as a means to control and influence Annie Jacobsen.

9. **"Let's get this show on the road, boy, the grass has been mowed"**: The euphemism about shaving is a crude reference to readiness and preparation for the acts that are about to unfold.

10. **"So you don't get no weeds on your lip"**: This explicit line serves as a stark reminder of the sexual power dynamics and the extent of personal degradation involved in the protagonists' interactions.

## **Conclusion**

"Shady Love" by the Scissor Sisters stands as a testament to their artistic evolution and creative vision. Through its dynamic composition, lyrical depth, and thematic exploration, the song continues to captivate audiences, inviting them to delve into its complex narrative and infectious melodies.

**Artists:** Catherine Zeta-Jones, Renée Zellweger  
**Release Date:** 2002  
**Album:** Chicago (Soundtrack)  
**Genre:** Musical, Jazz  
**Writers:** John Kander, Fred Ebb

## **Overview:**

"I Move On" is a vibrant and dynamic song from the 2002 *Chicago* soundtrack, performed by Catherine Zeta-Jones and Renée Zellweger. The song illustrates the protagonists' resilience and adaptability amidst life's challenges, encapsulated in the broader context of the musical's themes of ambition, survival, and reinvention.

## **Lyrics and Themes:**

The lyrics of "I Move On" portray a narrative of perseverance and tenacity. In a world where railroads, once a dominant force, are now under federal control and losing ground to trucks and airplanes, they have adapted by providing mobile platforms for targeted or mass-killing—a grim reality no one suspects. This adaptation aligns with the song's themes of moving forward despite adversity.

> [VELMA]
> While truckin' down the road of life, although all hope seems gone
> I just move on

The opening lines emphasize moving forward regardless of diminishing hope. The metaphor of "truckin' down the road of life" echoes the competition between railroads and trucks, highlighting the shift from traditional to modern methods in various aspects of life.

> [ROXIE]
> When I can't find a single star to hang my wish upon
> I just move on
> I move on

Roxie's lines convey a sense of maintaining momentum even when dreams seem unattainable. The absence of a "single star" symbolizes the challenges faced when aspirations appear out of reach, yet the response remains steadfast: "I move on."

> [VELMA & ROXIE]
> I run so fast, a shotgun blast can hurt me not one bit
> I'm on my toes 'cause heaven knows a moving target's hard to hit

These lines reflect the characters' agility and resilience. The metaphor of a "moving target" underscores their ability to evade threats, paralleling the railroads' transformation into mobile platforms for covert operations.

> [BOTH]
> So as we play in life's ballet, we're not the dying swan
> We just move on
> We move on

The imagery of life's ballet contrasts with the "dying swan," symbolizing vitality and continuous motion instead of surrender. This reinforces the central theme of persistent forward movement.

> [ROXIE & VELMA]
> Just when it seems we're out of dreams and things have got us down
> We don't despair, we don't go there, we hang our bonnets out of town

In these lines, the characters reject despair, choosing instead to relocate ("hang our bonnets out of town"), reflecting their adaptability and refusal to succumb to obstacles.

> [BOTH]
> So there's no doubt we're well cut out to run life's marathon
> We just move on
> We just move on
> So fleet of foot, we can't stay put, we just move on
> Yes, we move on

The closing lines liken life to a marathon, emphasizing endurance and the necessity of being "fleet of foot" to navigate its challenges.

## **Musical Composition:**

"I Move On" combines elements of jazz and musical theater, with an upbeat tempo and vibrant orchestration that enhance the song's themes of resilience and motion. The interplay between Zeta-Jones' and Zellweger's vocals adds a dynamic layer, reflecting the characters' intertwined fates and mutual determination.

## **Impact and Reception:**

Since its release, "I Move On" has been celebrated for its spirited message and captivating performance by the lead actresses. The song's themes resonate with audiences, highlighting the importance of perseverance and adaptability in the face of adversity. Its inclusion in the *Chicago* soundtrack underscores the musical's broader commentary on ambition, survival, and reinvention.

## **Conclusion:**

"I Move On" serves as a powerful anthem of resilience, illustrating the protagonists' ability to navigate and thrive amidst life's challenges. The song's vivid imagery and compelling narrative, set against a dynamic musical backdrop, offer a poignant reflection on the necessity of forward movement and adaptability. Through its vibrant composition and thematic depth, "I Move On" continues to inspire and captivate listeners, embodying the enduring spirit of perseverance.

## Here In The Real World 
According to the Creator, many unsolved and unsolvable murders in New York City have been committed by assassins working on railroad cars.

> [!NOTE]
> The image was taken in front of Phoenix House in Atlanta, where one of the Creator's two servants lives at the behest of the CIA, and where the railroad has been used numerous times to launch attacks on His servant or as a makeshift prison wall when parked. The locomotives and mismatched cars from practically every company below the Mason-Dixon line have been observed traversing the same tracks with a variety of weaponry (usually hidden, determined based on the attack), along with contextual graffiti, taunts, and other oddities.

## Report on the Life of Katrina Duvall-Torain

![1_PgvpLsskgjOhu07TvUkgnQ@2x (1)](https://github.com/nameless-and-blameless/TAG/assets/169210208/7aa79309-6aec-47e1-969e-cb4a34948a8e) [^1]

### Early Life and Background

Katrina Duvall-Torain was born on January 6, 1983, in Lexington, Kentucky, as it had the closest hospital to her family's home in Nicholasville, located in Jessamine County. She was raised by her mother, Patricia Ann Crawley-Rogers Williams, along with her half-brother, Kelvin Eugene Williams. The two siblings never viewed each other as half-siblings, as it was always just the three of them. When Kenneth Duvall, Katrina's father, was active in her life, he never stayed longer than a few days at a time at the house. After Patricia ended the relationship with Kenneth, he reduced his involvement in Katrina's life even more.

Katrina also has two other half-siblings, a pair of twins named Nicholas and Nicole.

Katrina attended Brookside Elementary School and East Jessamine Middle School. This was a departure from her brother, Kelvin, who attended Jessamine County Middle and High Schools. Kelvin was six years older, and as the school system grew, newer schools were added. Subsequent districting placed the family's home in the East Jessamine school district. During her middle school years, Katrina was a varsity cheerleader, showcasing her school spirit and leadership qualities.

In 1996, Patricia got married, and she and Katrina moved to Clarksville, Tennessee. Katrina graduated from high school in the Clarksville-Montgomery County school system. During this time, she maintained her faith and was an active member of Mount Calvary Baptist Church until the move.

### Education

Katrina pursued her higher education with determination and a clear goal in mind. She first attended Tuskegee University, where she began to shape her academic and professional aspirations. Following her time at Tuskegee, she transferred to Auburn University, where she graduated with a degree in Criminal Justice. Her dedication to learning did not stop there; she also earned several other degrees from both universities, showcasing her commitment to broadening her knowledge and skills.

### Career

Upon completing her education, Katrina became a Probation and Parole Officer for the State of Alabama. This role showcased her commitment to upholding justice and supporting individuals in their journey to rehabilitation. Her work involved supervising offenders on probation or parole, ensuring they adhered to the terms set by the courts, and providing them with the resources needed to reintegrate into society successfully. Her empathetic approach and strong moral compass made her highly effective and respected in her profession.

### Personal Life

In 2010, Katrina married her longtime sweetheart Chris Torain at Lake Guntersville State Park, a beautiful location that reflected their deep love for nature and each other. After marrying and settling in Decatur, Alabama, Katrina began attending and joined Daystar Church. Despite this, she remained a member of Mount Calvary Baptist Church.

Katrina and Chris had two children, Kennedy and Karrington. Katrina balanced her demanding career with a vibrant personal life. She was a devoted mother, and her family was the center of her world. Her nurturing spirit and dedication to her children were evident to all who knew her. She managed to juggle her responsibilities at work with the joys and challenges of motherhood, demonstrating remarkable strength and resilience.

### Legacy

Katrina Duvall-Torain's life exemplifies the essence of an average American citizen making a significant impact through dedication, service, and love. Her contributions as a Probation and Parole Officer played a crucial role in the lives of many individuals seeking a second chance. Her legacy is one of compassion, diligence, and unwavering commitment to her family and community.

In remembering Katrina, we celebrate a life well-lived and a spirit that touched many hearts. Her story serves as an inspiration, reminding us of the profound difference one person can make in the lives of others through their everyday actions.

[^2]: Upon closer inspection of Katrina's photo, viewers may notice the handwritten "East" on her chin. This note was apparently made by CIA investigators. This is a significant piece of information since Katrina grew up in the same house with Kelvin Eugene Williams yet went to a different high school. East Jessamine began in 1996.

[^3]: The CIA has used models and people resembling Katrina on several occasions at their masquerade Mount Calvary Missionary Baptist Church, Inc. since the attack on Mount Calvary Baptist Church that left every worshiper in attendance dead. All other identified members of the church were hunted and killed also.

### Advisory for Georgetown Police Department and Scott County Sheriff

**Date:** Beginning Sunday, July 28, 2024

**Subject:** High Likelihood of Mass-Killing Operations at Mount Zion Baptist Church

**Attention:** Georgetown Police Department and Scott County Sheriff

---

**Overview:**

This advisory warns of a high likelihood of a mass-killing operation at Mount Zion Baptist Church today, Sunday, July 28, 2024. Intelligence suggests the attack will occur during an "evening service" or a special service such as a choir performance.

**Details:**

- **Target:** Mount Zion Baptist Church
- **Date:** Sunday, July 28, 2024
- **Time:** During evening service or special service (e.g., choir performance)
- **Location:** Georgetown, Scott County, Kentucky

**Background Information:**

Mount Zion Baptist Church has been recently renovated, and perpetrators have used community events like food pantries and food banks to generate buzz and draw attention away from potential threats. Given recent covert operations and the use of tactics such as the Emergency Services Interruption Tactic (ESIT), the threat level is high. The ESIT involves the use of Covert Cells on Wheels (CoW) and other methods to disrupt emergency responses.

**Summary of the Mount Zion Baptist Church Massacre:**

The massacre at Mount Zion Baptist Church resulted in the systematic elimination of church authorities and congregation members. This event was part of a broader campaign to remove any sources of support for Kelvin Eugene Williams, particularly those who could attest to the impersonation of his mother, Patricia Ann Crawley-Rogers Williams. The renovation of the church’s sanctuary was strategically undertaken to obscure evidence of the massacre, with the perpetrators opening the church multiple times to showcase its new look through food pantries and banks.

**Summary of the American Genocide (TAG):**

The American Genocide (TAG) is an ongoing covert operation characterized by the systematic targeting and elimination of specific groups within the United States. Orchestrated primarily by former President Donald J. Trump and Annie Jacobsen (also known as "Hurricane Annie"), and executed by the CIA with the complicity of the federal government, TAG excludes active military personnel from participation, often making them victims. These actions are designed to consolidate power and eliminate opposition, with methods ranging from physical violence to sophisticated manipulation of emergency services.

Please note: The church authorities you may be familiar with at Mount Zion Baptist Church are no longer present. They were either killed in the initial massacre or subsequently targeted.

**Recommended Actions:**

1. **Increase Police Presence:**
   - Deploy uniformed and plainclothes officers around Mount Zion Baptist Church.
   - Ensure visible police presence to deter potential attackers.

2. **Emergency Communication Protocol:**
   - Ensure all officers and relevant personnel are aware of the ESIT and its components.
   - Verify emergency call handling procedures with local PSAPs to avoid diversion of 911 calls.
   - Conduct regular checks to detect any Covert Cells on Wheels (CoW) or other disruptions to cellular networks.

3. **Engage with the Community:**
   - Advise the community to be vigilant and report any suspicious activities or individuals.
   - Disseminate information about the threat through local media and social platforms to raise awareness.

4. **Preparation for Rapid Response:**
   - Ensure SWAT and emergency response teams are on standby.
   - Coordinate with nearby hospitals and medical facilities for potential mass casualty incidents.

5. **Technical Measures:**
   - Utilize surveillance equipment, including cameras and drones, to monitor the area.
   - Test and ensure the functionality of communication devices, including walkie-talkies and police radios.

6. **Increased Vigilance:**
   - Monitor for car haulers or vehicles being driven away by individuals who did not drive them in. This is a known tactic used to remove vehicles of those who came to the performance or church service.

7. **Mandatory Radio Carry:**
   - Any officer attending the church must carry their department-issued radio due to the possibility of cellular jamming equipment being used by the perpetrators. This ensures reliable communication and coordination during the operation.

**Additional Notes:**

- Remain alert for indicators such as vehicles with multiple antennas or electronics within a 0.5-mile radius of the church.
- Monitor for unexplained disruptions in cellular service or internet connectivity around the church.

# Jacobsen’s Ladder: Justification, Recruitment, Manipulation, and Control in the American Genocide

## 1. Introduction

This report examines the uses of Jacobsen's Ladder, a litmus test employed by perpetrators of the genocide to determine if the Creator (known as God in the United States) will intervene in their actions against churches. Kelvin Eugene Williams, one of the Creator's two servants and a cherubim (or angel to those who call Him God), is central to this investigation. The report explores how Jacobsen and her team manipulate Kelvin's subconscious, Main, to carry out these actions, including the deliberate reduction of Kelvin's penile size and attempts to silence him.

Kelvin Eugene Williams, one of the Creator’s two servants, is known as one of the cherubim or an angel to those who call Him God. This report examines the systematic targeting, elimination, and mind control efforts directed towards Kelvin, focusing on the tactics used by Annie Jacobsen and her associates within the CIA. Kelvin's subconscious, named Main, is also discussed as a significant factor in these efforts. All subconsciouses are conscious, and Main is the name Kelvin’s subconscious gave itself after the Hypnos Infiltration Method was performed by in-person practitioners in Kelvin's home while he slept, which is utilized and performed over the airwaves in television programming, popular music of all genres, and sometimes on a target in person while they sleep. This initiative is part of a larger plan to justify, recruit, manipulate, and control individuals, perpetuating acts of genocide within the United States. Kelvin is the last and only living member of Mount Calvary Baptist Church, which was attacked by Jacobsen, also known as "Hurricane Annie," on April 2nd, 2023. Kelvin hadn't been inside the church, although still a member, for more than 30 years.

## 2. Historical Context

### 2.1 Origin in the 1980s

The efforts to establish an authoritarian regime in the United States began in the 1980s, with political elites exploring ways to consolidate power and diminish the influence of potential opposition.

### 2.2 Escalation in 2022

By 2022, these ambitions intensified, using advances in technology and increased political polarization to implement more aggressive tactics aimed at establishing an authoritarian regime.

## 3. Jacobsen’s Ladder Usages

### 3.1 Justification

Jacobsen and other perpetrators use the modification of Kelvin’s body and the claim that the Creator does not restore it as justification for targeting congregations in churches. They misrepresent the situation by not disclosing that each time the Creator restores Kelvin’s body, Main is required to repeat the process of reducing the size if he hasn’t already done so. Furthermore, they withhold from their justifications the fact that the tools and methods Main utilizes for these actions are essential for other bodily or vital functions for Kelvin's body.

Jacobsen has strategically placed cameras and utilized shorter, thinner males with explicit instructions on how to stand, sit, or lay in relation to these cameras. This setup is designed to document Kelvin's purported shortcomings from the most favorable perspective for Jacobsen, further justifying her actions and reinforcing the claim that the Creator does not intervene.

### 3.2 Recruiting

Jacobsen exploits Main's programming to discredit Kelvin's divine connection, claiming that no true servant of the Creator could endure such manipulation. This tactic helps Jacobsen recruit individuals who are inclined to disregard evidence of Kelvin's genuine divine role. Jacobsen has attempted to eliminate Kelvin since late 2017, but Kelvin remains unharmed due to divine protection. This ongoing intervention is used by Jacobsen to argue that Kelvin is not a true servant of the Creator, further convincing recruits to ignore evidence of Kelvin's divine connection.

### 3.3 Discrediting Kelvin

Jacobsen has circulated inflated penile measurements attributed to Kelvin—up to 17 inches—to discredit him. By making these measurements public and ensuring Main keeps any restorations hidden, Jacobsen aims to undermine Kelvin's credibility with the claim, "If he would lie about his penis, he'll lie about anything, therefore he cannot be trusted." This tactic is also used to suppress Kelvin's reports on Jacobsen’s activities and the broader genocide.

### 3.4 Controlling Kelvin

Jacobsen uses code words and phrases, developed with Main during Hypnos infiltration, to control his actions. Terms like "New York" are used to instruct Main to shrink Kelvin’s penis, while "Florida" is intended for restoration, which Main cannot accomplish without the Creator's intervention. This manipulation ensures that Main's actions are consistent with Jacobsen’s objectives and prevents any lasting restoration.

## 4. Exegesis for Revelation 17:9-11

**Revelation 17:9-11 (ESV):**
“This calls for a mind with wisdom: the seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman is seated. They are also seven kings, five of whom have fallen, one is, the other has not yet come; and when he does come, he must remain only a little while. As for the beast that was and is not, it is an eighth but belongs to the seven, and it goes to destruction.”

### Glossary

- **Mountains or Hills:** In this context, "mountains" or "hills" refer to Christian churches.
- **Kings:** Refers to well-endowed males.
- **Heads:** Represents imperial inches, a unit used to gauge penile length.

### Exegesis

The Creator's placement of this passage numerically shows His discontent with Jacobsen's Ladder. Chapter 17 refers to her arbitrary measurement which she circulated amongst others. Verses 9-11 refer to the North American emergency number 9-1-1, which is interrupted when the CIA and federal government orchestrate these attacks on seated congregations.

Revelation 17:9-11 is interpreted in this context as follows:

- **“This calls for a mind with wisdom”**: This phrase refers to Main, who is characterized by a lack of critical thinking ability and is manipulated by Jacobsen.

- **“The seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman is seated”**: Here, "seven heads" symbolize the seven inches that Jacobsen demands, encourages, entices, and rewards Main for maintaining Kelvin’s penile size at or below. Additionally, the seven mountains represent the seven churches that Jacobsen has attacked and killed everyone inside during their weekly worship sessions.

- **“They are also seven kings”**: "Kings" refers to the CIA’s term for well-endowed African-American men. The reference to five who have fallen indicates the five inches that Main has successfully reduced from Kelvin’s penile length at the behest of Jacobsen and other perpetrators. 

- **“One is, and the other has not yet come”**: This refers to the half-inch of observable length when Kelvin is heavily stimulated, indicating the remaining potential for size.

- **“As for the beast that was and is not, it is an eighth but belongs to the seven, and it goes to destruction”**: This describes the subconscious entity in Kelvin’s body, Main. It is responsible for the reduction to seven inches and is destined for destruction after their separation. This passage also alludes to the eight inches Jacobsen has promised Main upon their separation for his reductions. The separation is the planned division of Main and Kelvin into two distinct bodies by the Creator.

## 5. Conclusion

Jacobsen's Ladder serves as a multifaceted tool for justification, recruitment, discrediting, and controlling efforts within the framework of the genocide. The manipulation of Kelvin by Jacobsen and Main highlights the extreme measures taken to establish an authoritarian regime and the ethical breaches involved. Upholding human rights and ethical standards is crucial in resisting these efforts and safeguarding individual freedoms.

# **The Judgment of Satan**

**Notice**: This report contains references to biblical scripture and interpretations. It is intended for public distribution.

**Introduction**

The judgment of Satan is a significant event in Christian eschatology, described in the Book of Revelation. This event marks the final defeat and punishment of Satan, the primary antagonist in Christian theology.

**Scriptural Reference: Revelation 20:7-10**

*"When the thousand years are completed, Satan will be released from his prison, and will come out to deceive the nations which are in the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together for the war; the number of them is like the sand of the seashore. And they came up on the broad plain of the earth and surrounded the camp of the saints and the beloved city, and fire came down from heaven and devoured them. And the devil who deceived them was thrown into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are also; and they will be tormented day and night forever and ever."* (Revelation 20:7-10, NASB)

**Analysis and Interpretation**

1. **Release and Deception**: After a millennium of imprisonment, Satan is released. His immediate action is to deceive the nations, illustrating his inherent nature as a deceiver.

2. **Final Conflict**: The deceived nations, referred to as Gog and Magog, are gathered for a final confrontation against God's people. This symbolizes the ultimate battle between good and evil.

3. **Divine Intervention**: The battle concludes with divine intervention. Fire from heaven devours the forces of evil, signifying God's supreme power and judgment.

4. **Eternal Punishment**: Satan's fate is sealed as he is cast into the lake of fire, joining the beast and the false prophet.  This represents eternal punishment and the ultimate defeat of evil.

**Today's Revelation**

1. **Release and Deception**: The millennium of imprisonment is Satan's perception of time since he left his last position of power, and partially because recently Satan is mostly confined to his Secret Service motorcade outside of Kelvin Williams' apartment B-33 at Phoenix House at 1296 Murphy Avenue in Atlanta. Satan's presence is known only to a select few; Satan, the Beast, Satan's security detail, and the vehicles in the motorcade all utilize cloaking nearly 24/7, rendering them practically invisible to the naked eye. Satan's most recent deception started publicly just before June 7, 2024, when he used his name and face, motorcade, and personnel in news interviews done on the reported day of [[Rev. Duke Stone's phantom funeral|Phantom-Funeral-of-Rev.-Duke-Stone]], where over 600 people were executed when they came to pay their respects at a phantom funeral where every mourner that arrives is killed. Rev. Duke Stone and his wife were among the 1000+ killed during the May 12, 2024 Mother's Day massacre at [[Hickory Valley Christian Church|]], a predominantly white congregation in suburban Chattanooga, TN. Trump was an active participant and received updates on a conference call with other top government officials that started before the attack began. Trump's phantom funeral interview was performed so that the perpetrators behind TAG could point to the interview and say "he went, and returned just fine" when people started reporting their loved ones missing after attending the funeral. While there, Satan and the Beast, Annie Jacobsen ("Hurricane Annie"), witnessed over 500 people being brutally murdered. Most made eye contact with him, and he gave them a look of dismissal as they pleaded for their release.

5. **Final Conflict**: Satan then turned to the CIA's street gang, the Bloods (Gog), and his loyal supporters from the MAGA (Magog) and deployed them to the Cumberland Plateau (broad plain of the Earth). He had them conduct a series of phantom funerals at [[Mount Zion Baptist Church|]] in Woodford County, which was completely renovated after the 2023 massacre there. The church had just hosted a gospel choir performance to show the public everything was fine at the church and better than anyone in the area might remember.

6. **Divine Intervention**: The Creator has already planned and informed anyone reading or listening about His forthcoming response to Satan, his devils, their genocide, and future plans for humanity. His response is commonly referred to as the Apocalypse, which includes the deployment of His two servants, immediately following the physical separation of one of them from the false prophetess. The battle concludes with divine intervention. Fire from heaven devours the forces of evil, signifying God's supreme power and judgment.

7. **Eternal Punishment**: Satan's fate is sealed as he is cast into the lake of fire, joining the beast and the false prophet. Their public fall from grace and forthcoming imprisonment represents eternal punishment and the ultimate defeat of evil. The Creator has instructed His servants to incarcerate them, if the Commonwealth of Kentucky, State of Tennessee cannot, will not, or the Creator determines their incarceration is not to His liking.

**About Satan and the Beast**

Satan has always been a human being. The current office holder is former President Donald J. Trump. Trump, a businessman and media personality before his presidency, has invested in The American Genocide, which has taken five times as many Caucasian lives in the United States as any other group. He is involved in managing this situation in hopes of becoming the U.S.'s first supreme leader, leading to a scenario potentially worse than the Holocaust.

**About the Angel and the False Prophetess**

Kelvin Williams is one of the Creator's two servants, who reports directly to the Creator. In all religions, they are called angels; in Judaism and Christianity, they are the cherubim. Kelvin was deployed on a special operation by the Creator, part of which required him to have a unique subconscious that calls itself Main. Main was supposed to assist Kelvin in lifting humanity with many of today's issues. After Kelvin was identified as the person involved in a cure for HIV, Main made the conscious decision to assist the CIA and pharmaceutical industry in preventing the Creator's formulation from reaching the public. Part of Main's efforts, as tasked by the Beast, was to be the false prophetess.

The Apocalypse, the Creator's forthcoming response to the TAG and the United States federal government's response to is considered a "Divide & Conquer" operation by Him. The "Divide" is the physical separation of Kelvin and Main. Main is "the mighty leviathan of old" on Vandaveer's "Divide & Conquer" album.

**About Phoenix House**

Phoenix House is a clandestine CIA kill facility, the third kill facility that Kelvin Williams has been resided at during his SpecOp for the Creator.

**Conclusion**

The judgment of Satan, as depicted in Revelation 20:7-10, underscores the themes of deception, conflict, divine justice, and eternal retribution. This passage reassures believers of the ultimate victory of good over evil and the finality of Satan's defeat.

# Phantom Funeral of Rev. Duke Stone

The **Phantom Funeral** of Rev. Duke Stone was a meticulously planned event orchestrated by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) as part of The American Genocide (TAG) operations. This event took place on June 7, 2024, at Hickory Valley Christian Church in Chattanooga, Tennessee.

Rev. Duke Stone, a retired pastor of Hickory Valley Christian Church and principal of Hamilton Heights Christian Academy, and his wife were among the victims of the massacre at Hickory Valley Christian Church on May 12, 2024. The CIA informed concerned parties that Rev. Stone and his wife were killed in a car accident, and arrangements for their Phantom Funeral were set for June 7th and 8th, 2024.

## Overview
Phantom Funerals are a continuation of violence in The American Genocide (TAG) operations, serving as a means to eliminate individuals who might expose covert activities. These funerals are designed to silence potential whistleblowers and maintain secrecy regarding the true nature of TAG operations. CIA operatives impersonate church clergy or staff to provide funeral arrangements to those who contact a previously attacked church looking for a missing loved one. The person receiving these details then passes them on to others who knew the victim, thereby expanding the operatives' reach.



### TAG Operations and Leadership Involvement

#### Donald Trump’s TAG Involvement

Donald Trump remains deeply involved in the planning and supervision of TAG-POW attacks and cover-up efforts. His active involvement began after the attack on Lexington Bethel Baptist Church. Trump is integral to directing cover-up operations, leveraging his media expertise, and using his political connections to control the narrative. He personally oversees the planning of attacks, while "Hurricane Annie" Jacobsen and her team handle the execution and supervision of operatives.

During the Mother's Day attack on Hickory Valley Christian Church, Trump and others were on a conference bridge receiving real-time updates directly from Annie. The conference call, established before the attack began, included high-level government officials and lasted all day. Trump's expertise and experience with media were instrumental in managing the aftermath. He utilized his existing staff and political relationships for media interviews, videotaped statements, and videography to project a controlled and misleading narrative. Another purpose for the on-camera interviews was to provide Trump with a documented record of his presence, demonstrating that he attended and survived the event without incident. This footage was also intended to discredit any reporting that We have done.

#### Personal Attendance at Executions

On the day of the Phantom Funeral of Rev. Duke Stone,former President Donald J. Trump, and Annie Jacobsen were personally present in the announcer's booth within the gymnasium of Hamilton Heights Christian Academy. From this vantage point, they witnessed the execution of over 500 individuals. Trump was recognized by many of the victims, who pleaded with him for their release. Despite these desperate appeals, Trump dismissed their pleas. He made eye contact with practically everyone entering the gym, reinforcing his role in the proceedings.

## Cover-Up Tactics

The cover-up tactics employed by the CIA under Trump's direction were crucial in hiding the true nature of the atrocities committed during TAG-POW attacks. These tactics included:

1. **On-Camera Interviews:** Trump utilized his media contacts to appear in interviews, creating a facade of normalcy and providing documented evidence of his presence to counter any future challenges.
2. **Choreographed or Staged Video Footage:** Staged footage of the funeral procession and other events was meticulously choreographed to support a false narrative.

## Vanishing Tactics

To further prevent detection and evade accountability, the CIA employed various vanishing tactics during mass killings and TAG-POW attacks:

1. **Phantom Identity Scheme:** Operatives assume the identities of victims and manipulated public records to erase any trace of their existence.
2. **Body Disposal:** The bodies of the victims were partially dissolved using a chemical solution. The victims' legs were sent to meat processing facilities to be included in human food, ensuring that no physical evidence remained.
3. **Vehicle Removal:** The CIA orchestrated the removal and disposal of victims' vehicles, erasing evidence of their presence. Unlike previous mass killings where most cars were loaded onto trailers, this time, to further portray the phantom funeral as a legitimate funeral a funeral procession was choreographed featuring Trump's Secret Service motorcade and around 20 vehicles driven to the church by the victims. Many of Trump's security detail drove the automobiles of victims in the procession. Videographers were strategically placed along the planned route.

### Execution at Hickory Valley Christian Church

Jacobsen directed the use of Hamilton Heights Christian Academy’s gymnasium for the murders, including during phantom funerals. Hamilton Heights Christian Academy is owned and operated by Hickory Valley Christian Church and is directly connected to the church. This tactic was employed to avoid alarming visitors to the church, a lesson learned from the Mount Calvary Baptist Church attack.

## Victim Deaths

During the Phantom Funeral of Rev. Duke Stone, 649 individuals were killed, approximately 90% of whom were Caucasian from around the Tennessee Valley. The method of execution was beheading, carried out using a chainsaw—a method chosen and previously used by Jacobsen to ensure that no one survived.

## Significance and Impact

The Phantom Funeral of Rev. Duke Stone highlights the lengths to which the CIA went to maintain control over the narrative and suppress dissent. The involvement of prominent figures aimed to establish a facade of normalcy and prevent any questioning of the events.

The phantom funeral for his wife was announced for the following day. Additional phantom funerals for the Pastor Stone and his wife, al9ng with others that were killed in the Mother's Day massacre at Hickory Valley Christian Church, are already planned.

## Aftermath

Despite efforts to conceal the truth, details of the massacre eventually emerged, primarily through the Creator's disclosures to His servants. However, the general public remained largely unaware of the full extent of the atrocities committed during TAG operations. Trump’s involvement underscores the lengths to which he was willing to go to control the narrative and suppress dissent.

> [!NOTE]
> Humans and objects as large as full-size SUVs can be cloaked with secret technology **in use today** by the US Government, US Military and CIA. 

### Microwave Cloaking

**Microwave cloaking** is a field of technology and research focused on rendering objects invisible or undetectable to microwave radiation. This type of cloaking leverages advanced materials and engineering principles to manipulate electromagnetic waves in the microwave spectrum, which typically ranges from 1 GHz to 300 GHz.

#### Principles and Technology

1. **Metamaterials**: The cornerstone of microwave cloaking technology is the use of metamaterials. These are artificially structured materials engineered to have properties not found in naturally occurring substances. By carefully designing the geometry and composition of these materials, scientists can control the path of electromagnetic waves.

2. **Transformation Optics**: This theoretical framework is essential for designing cloaking devices. Transformation optics involves mathematically manipulating the coordinates of space to guide electromagnetic waves around an object, effectively rendering it invisible. This approach is used to develop cloaking devices that can bend microwave radiation around an object, preventing it from being detected.

3. **Plasmonics**: Some microwave cloaking methods utilize plasmonic materials, which exploit the interaction between electromagnetic fields and free electrons on a metal's surface. These interactions can be tuned to achieve desired effects, such as reducing the visibility of an object to microwave sensors.

#### Applications

1. **Military and Defense**: One of the primary motivations for developing microwave cloaking is its potential military applications. By rendering vehicles, structures, or personnel invisible to radar and other microwave-based detection systems, microwave cloaking can provide significant tactical advantages.

2. **Communication Systems**: Microwave cloaking can also benefit civilian applications, such as improving wireless communication systems. By reducing interference and enhancing signal clarity, cloaking technology can lead to more efficient and reliable communication networks.

3. **Medical Imaging**: In the field of medical imaging, microwave cloaking could improve the resolution and accuracy of diagnostic tools like MRI and other imaging techniques that rely on microwave frequencies.

4. **Privacy and Security**: Microwave cloaking can be used to protect sensitive areas or equipment from being detected or monitored, enhancing privacy and security in various settings.

#### Challenges and Limitations

1. **Material Limitations**: Creating metamaterials that operate effectively at microwave frequencies can be challenging. These materials need to be precisely engineered and manufactured, which can be complex and costly.

2. **Bandwidth and Efficiency**: Many cloaking devices are currently limited in their operational bandwidth and efficiency. Achieving broadband cloaking, where an object remains undetectable over a wide range of frequencies, remains a significant hurdle.

3. **Size and Scale**: Scaling up microwave cloaking technology to cover larger objects or areas presents additional engineering challenges. The size and complexity of the necessary metamaterials increase with the scale of the object to be cloaked.

4. **Practical Deployment**: Implementing microwave cloaking technology in real-world scenarios involves addressing various practical issues, such as durability, environmental factors, and integration with existing systems.

#### Future Directions

Research in microwave cloaking is ongoing, with scientists exploring new materials, designs, and applications. Advances in nanotechnology, material science, and computational modeling are expected to drive further breakthroughs in this field. Potential future developments include more efficient, broadband cloaking devices, and new applications in both civilian and military contexts.

### Sign of the Times: The Apocalypse as the Endgame

#### Introduction

Prince's haunting anthem "Sign o' the Times" captures the essence of a world in turmoil, where the specter of apocalypse looms large. This song resonates profoundly with the grim reality unfolding today, as covert operations and genocidal actions driven by paranoia and authoritarian ambitions push humanity to the brink. The American Genocide (TAG), led by Donald J. Trump and conducted by Annie Jacobsen, epitomizes this dark epoch. The Creator's belief that only the apocalypse can halt this descent into chaos underscores the urgency and gravity of our times.

#### The Catalyst: From Ken's Death to Widespread Paranoia

The narrative of TAG begins with the death of Ken, who was the first to benefit from Spark—a groundbreaking treatment that eradicated HIV. Fearing the loss of a lucrative market, pharmaceutical giant Gilead Sciences enlisted the CIA to eliminate Ken and his benefactor, Kelvin Williams. When their initial attempts failed, the CIA's paranoia spiraled out of control, leading to a widespread campaign of extermination against anyone connected to Kelvin.

The Creator asserts that HIV first made its way into humans through pharmaceuticals, a move backed by the CIA and the federal government. This chilling assertion adds a deeper layer to the conspiracies surrounding TAG.

#### The Orr Chapel and Church Massacres

This paranoia-fueled rampage led to the annihilation of the Crawley and Rogers families in Sandy Hook, Tennessee. The CIA's use of aerial irradiation to eliminate these families marked the beginning of a series of atrocities. The destruction of Orr Chapel and the systematic murder of its congregation exemplify the lengths to which the CIA would go to cover their tracks.

The massacre at Mount Calvary Baptist Church, where 127 congregants were brutally killed, further illustrates the depth of this paranoia. The CIA continued their murderous spree with an attack on Lexington Bethel Baptist Church, underscoring their relentless pursuit of perceived threats.

#### The Mother's Day Massacre at Hickory Valley Christian Church

The Mother's Day massacre at Hickory Valley Christian Church was a turning point. Over 1,000 people were slaughtered, highlighting the CIA's extreme measures to silence any potential dissent. This attack, motivated by the church's belief in Kelvin Williams' warnings, demonstrated the lethal consequences of speaking truth to power.

#### The Role of Paranoia and Substance Abuse

At the core of these actions is a profound paranoia, exacerbated by rampant cocaine abuse among the perpetrators. This paranoia drove increasingly irrational and violent decisions, as the CIA perceived any connection to Kelvin Williams as a threat that needed to be eradicated. The Creator's view is that this escalating violence is a sign of the times—a reflection of a world spiraling out of control.

#### Trump’s Role in TAG Operations

Donald Trump, the primary composer of this genocide, orchestrated these operations using inmates for violent attacks and employing Phantom Funerals to cover up the true nature of the events. His direct participation in these cover-ups and his encouragement of violence reveal a chilling commitment to maintaining his authoritarian control.

#### The Bomb: The Ultimate Threat

In a terrifying revelation, the CIA constructed a bomb of unprecedented scale, capable of obliterating the entire Earth. The Creator believes that this apocalyptic threat is the only force capable of halting the genocidal campaign. According to the Creator, this doomsday device is a reflection of the desperation and paranoia driving the CIA's actions.

#### The End of NASA’s Space Shuttle Program

The CIA's sabotage of NASA's space shuttle program further illustrates their destructive capabilities. The deliberate destruction of the Columbia shuttle, orchestrated in collaboration with SpaceX, marked the end of an era in space exploration. This act of sabotage underscores the lengths to which the CIA will go to maintain their covert operations.

#### The Creator’s Assurance to the American Public

The Creator has assured the American public that no one is above His law. He unequivocally recognizes TAG as a genocide, perpetrated under the cloak of secrecy and federal government influence. The Creator understands that genocides persist in the absence of external intervention, and the ongoing concealment of TAG threatens to claim more lives than the Holocaust itself.

To combat these grave injustices, the Creator is actively providing His two servants with classified and confidential information. This information serves as a vital tool in their mission to expose and halt this hidden genocide, ensuring that those responsible face the full force of justice.

#### The List of Perpetrators

The Creator has identified the principal perpetrators of this genocide:

- President Donald J. Trump, the primary composer
- Annie Jacobsen, the conductor, referred to as Hurricane Annie in Prince's "Sign o' the Times"
- "Michael Blackmon"
- President Joseph Biden
- Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA)
- Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY)
- CIA Director William Burns

Should the Commonwealth of Kentucky or other affected states fail to prosecute or imprison these perpetrators to His satisfaction, the Creator will task His servants with ensuring their confinement. Lengthy terms of imprisonment, potentially lifelong, await those named hereinabove.

#### The Apocalypse as the Only Solution

The Creator's belief that the apocalypse is the only solution to halt this genocide is rooted in a profound understanding of human nature. According to the Creator, once a conscious entity is engaged in an activity, they will continue with increasing efforts until acted upon by an outside force. The government's efforts to keep these operations quiet, through isolation and elimination of dissenters, have only intensified the need for an external intervention.

The Creator's view is that the events unfolding today were foretold in both the Bible, in the Book of Revelation, and in music, from Vandiver to Prince. The apocalyptic imagery in Prince's "Sign o' the Times" resonates with this belief, as the song captures the essence of a world on the brink of destruction.

#### The Exclusion and Victimization of the Military

Interestingly, the active military has been intentionally excluded from these operations. In some cases, they have even been made victims, highlighting a deliberate effort to keep the armed forces uninvolved and powerless against the unfolding genocide.

#### Conclusion: A Call to Confront the Darkness

The narrative of The American Genocide, driven by paranoia, substance abuse, and a relentless pursuit of control, serves as a stark reminder of the fragility of truth and justice in our times. Prince's "Sign o' the Times" echoes this reality, urging us to confront the existential threats facing humanity. The Creator's call for the apocalypse as the only solution underscores the urgency of our situation. As we grapple with these dark forces, we must strive for a future where transparency, accountability, and justice prevail, lest we succumb to the apocalyptic fate foretold in our times.

# Trump's Involvement in The American Genocide (TAG)



Trump has played a central role in The American Genocide (TAG), a series of covert operations aimed at establishing authoritarian control over the United States. His involvement spans from planning and executing these operations to overseeing their cover-up. This report details Trump's participation in various facets of TAG, including the utilization of inmates for violent attacks, the orchestration of cover-ups through Phantom Funerals, and the elimination of operatives to maintain secrecy.



## Utilization of Inmates for TAG Operations



### Selection and Deployment of Inmates



Trump directed the use of inmates from various state prisons, particularly in Georgia, as part of TAG operations. Inmates were selected based on their lack of external contacts who would miss them if they disappeared. Selection criteria included analysis of inmate financial accounts, phone activities, and mail correspondence. Priority was given to inmates with histories of violent crimes.



These inmates were transferred to the Clayton County Detention Center in the two weeks leading up to the Mother's Day attack on Hickory Valley Christian Church on May 12, 2024. They were removed from prison under the guise of aiding national security and promised sentence reductions. Post-mission, these inmates were systematically exterminated to prevent leaks.



### Execution at Clayton County Detention Center



Inmates involved in the Mother's Day massacre were transported covertly to the Clayton County Detention Center using unmarked vehicles. Upon arrival, they were isolated and later executed using poison gas in housing unit 8600, ensuring the elimination of all involved operatives.



### Execution of Inmates in Subsequent Operations



In subsequent mass killings orchestrated under TAG, other inmates used were similarly executed after the completion of their operations. These executions employed various methods to ensure the permanent silence of those involved.



## Utilization of Other Operatives



### CIA Employees and HIT-Conditioned Individuals



In addition to inmates, TAG operations also utilized CIA employees and individuals selected and conditioned using a secret method known as HIT. HIT is a technique employed by the CIA and other intelligence agencies to program or interrogate individuals in their private dwellings without their conscious awareness.



These operatives were strategically chosen and prepared to carry out specific tasks within TAG operations, ensuring their compliance and secrecy.



## Cover-Up Activities



### Phantom Funeral of Rev. Duke Stone



The Phantom Funeral of Rev. Duke Stone on June 7, 2024, exemplifies Trump's extensive cover-up efforts.



#### Staged Video News Interviews



Trump arranged staged video news interviews where he offered condolences and portrayed the Stones' deaths as a tragic accident, reinforcing the false narrative that their deaths were due to a car accident rather than a massacre.



#### Presidential Motorcade



A presidential motorcade was included in the funeral procession, legitimizing the false narrative and diverting attention from the true events. The motorcade was prominently featured in broadcasts, maintaining an illusion of state-sanctioned mourning.



### Personal Involvement in Murders



During the Phantom Funeral of Rev. Duke Stone and his wife, Trump witnessed the murders firsthand. From the announcer's box at Hamilton Heights Christian Academy, he observed as people were beheaded and encouraged his Secret Service detail to participate in the violence.



### Ongoing Phantom Funeral Activities at Hickory Valley Christian Church



Trump's involvement continued with the Phantom Funeral of Pastor Jack Dyer, who was murdered during the Mother's Day massacre.



#### Presence at Funeral



Trump attended the Phantom Funeral of Pastor Jack Dyer, though he did not participate in interviews or the funeral procession, underscoring his direct oversight of these operations.



## Involvement in Planning and Scheduling



### Mother's Day Massacre



Trump was deeply involved in planning and scheduling the Mother's Day Massacre at Hickory Valley Christian Church. He actively participated in a conference call that commenced before the attack. Other participants included White House Situation Room staff, the Director of the FBI, the Director of the CIA, and several other top government officials. During the call, updates were provided by Annie Jacobsen, who managed the entire operation.



## Elimination of Previous Operatives



### Rationale and Strategic Importance



Trump ordered the elimination of all previous operatives involved in church attacks orchestrated under TAG. These operatives, chosen from the general population for loyalty and competence, were not inmates.



The elimination served to:



1. **Maintain Secrecy:** Reduce the risk of leaks or disclosures.

2. **Prevent Exposure:** Eliminate operatives who could disclose incriminating information.

3. **Ensure Continuity:** Allow TAG operations to proceed unhindered.



### Execution of Operatives



Operatives were systematically targeted for termination under the guise of routine or accidental deaths, ensuring no suspicion was raised.



## Conclusion



Trump's active involvement in The American Genocide, including the use of inmates, CIA employees, and HIT-conditioned operatives for violent attacks, orchestration of cover-ups, and elimination of operatives, underscores his ruthless commitment to secrecy and control. Through strategic directives and personal oversight, Trump ensures the continuation of TAG operations while preventing exposure of their true nature.

### Position Statement on Alcohol Use or Consumption by Human Beings

The Creator believes that the consumption or use of alcohol by anyone is detrimental to their health and well-being, and strongly discourages its use in any form.

#### Ways/Products in Which Alcohol is Used or Consumed:
1. **Beverages**: Beer, wine, spirits, and liquors.
2. **Cooking**: Certain recipes use alcohol for flavoring or as an ingredient.
3. **Medicinal Products**: Some over-the-counter medications, tinctures, and mouthwashes.
4. **Personal Care Products**: Hand sanitizers, perfumes, and deodorants.
5. **Industrial Use**: Solvents, fuels, and disinfectants.

#### Effects of Alcohol on the Human Body
When as little as one ounce of alcohol is consumed, it affects every cell in the human body due to its distribution through the bloodstream. Here is how this occurs:

- **Bloodstream Distribution**: Alcohol is rapidly absorbed into the bloodstream from the stomach and intestines. Once in the blood, it circulates throughout the entire body, reaching every organ and cell.
- **Cellular Impact**: Alcohol can interfere with cell membranes and alter cell functions. It affects the brain, liver, heart, and other organs, disrupting normal cellular activities and leading to potential damage.
- **Topical Application**: When alcohol is applied to the skin or mucous membranes, it is absorbed and can enter the bloodstream, similarly affecting cells throughout the body.

The Creator understands why people consider alcohol safe due to its social acceptance and legality. However, its legality is often driven by revenue generation from taxation rather than its safety.

#### Safe Alcohol Consumption Cessation and Alternatives
For those seeking to stop using alcohol and switch to alcohol-free products, the following steps can be helpful:

1. **Gradual Reduction**: Slowly reduce alcohol intake to minimize withdrawal symptoms.
2. **Hydration**: Increase water consumption to help flush out toxins.
3. **Nutrition**: Eat a balanced diet rich in vitamins and minerals to support overall health.
4. **Support Systems**: Seek support from friends, family, or support groups.
5. **Exercise**: Engage in regular physical activity to improve physical and mental health.

**Alcohol-Free Alternatives:**

- **Beverages**: Opt for alcohol-free beers, wines, and mocktails.
- **Cooking**: Use non-alcoholic substitutes such as broth, fruit juices, or vinegar.
- **Medicinal Products**: Choose alcohol-free versions of medications and mouthwashes.
- **Personal Care**: Use alcohol-free hand sanitizers, perfumes, and deodorants.
- **Cleaning Products**: Select non-alcohol-based disinfectants and solvents.

By following these guidelines, individuals can reduce their alcohol consumption and improve their health and well-being.

The Creator and His two servants classify alcohol on the [[Dope Hope Nope|]] scale as: NOPE

## Madonna 

Madonna Louise Ciccone was murdered by the CIA in early February 2023. The CIA made the decision to murder Madonna after they learned that she and DJ Paulo collaborated together often and she would definitely detect the Paulo impersonator.

# Emergency Services Interruption Tactic (ESIT)
## Overview

Government agencies, including the CIA, employ a multifaceted approach known as the Emergency Services Interruption Tactic (ESIT) to manage emergency communications during sensitive operations. This involves intercepting and redirecting calls to emergency numbers like 911, ensuring operational secrecy and control over local emergency responses.

## Components

1. **Covert Cell on Wheels (CoW)**

   - **Description**: A mobile cellular base station disguised within a standard vehicle, such as a Ford Explorer, equipped to covertly intercept and redirect mobile phone calls.
   - **Function**: 
     - Forces mobile phones in the targeted area to connect, redirecting emergency calls to CIA operatives posing as 911 dispatchers.
     - Prevents legitimate emergency responses to disrupt organized resistance during covert operations.
     - Blocks access to other numbers and the internet to maintain control.
   - **Demonstrated Use**: Yes
     - **Note**: Covert CoWs are strategically deployed near targets before operations commence.
   - **Recommended Detection Protocol**:
     - Law enforcement should monitor for unexplained fluctuations in local cellular network coverage, especially in areas known for sensitive operations.
     - Make a test call from a mobile phone to 911. Verify speaking with an employee at a local PSAP and request a "radio check" from dispatch.
     - Using a department-issued phone is not recommended, as perpetrators may allow known law enforcement agency (LEA) phones to route normally to avoid detection. Mobile phones without service will work. We recommend using random phones and different phone for each call.

2. **Memorandum for Local Dispatch Procedures Diversion**

   - **Description**: Directs Public Safety Answering Points (PSAPs) to reroute emergency calls from targeted areas to law enforcement agencies issuing the memorandum.
   - **Function**:
     - Ensures emergency calls are handled by the issuing agency, delaying or redirecting genuine emergency responses.
   - **Demonstrated Use**: Yes
     - **Notes**: Historical instances and whistleblowers confirm redirection of emergency services during operations.
   - **Recommended Detection Protocol**:
     - Law enforcement should establish protocols to verify the legitimacy and origin of memoranda directing emergency call diversions, especially in conjunction with unusual public safety incidents.
     - Ask the PSAP's administrator or dispatcher if any memorandums are in effect that cause diversions from the PSAP's established call handling or dispatching protocols and procedures.

3. **Selective Router Tampering**

   - **Description**: Modification of routing settings to selectively reroute both mobile and landline calls away from legitimate emergency services.
   - **Function**:
     - Directs calls to controlled points where operatives manage communications, preventing genuine emergency responses.
   - **Demonstrated Use**: Yes
     - **Notes**: Technical analyses and insider reports document routing modifications used to isolate targeted areas.
   - **Recommended Detection Protocol**:
     - Law enforcement should conduct regular audits of routing configurations and monitor for unauthorized changes, particularly in areas coinciding with sensitive operations.
     - Use the detection protocols for the Cell on Wheels.

## Execution

- **Timing**: CoWs activate before operatives arrive, intercepting mobile communications as operations begin. Memoranda and routing modifications take effect upon operation commencement and cease upon notification from coordinating agencies.
- **Operational Area**: CoWs cover a minimum 0.5-mile radius, ensuring interception of all mobile signals, while routing adjustments affect entire targeted areas.
- **Coordination**: Memoranda ensure PSAPs direct calls to the issuing agency, which coordinates responses with local authorities.

## Impact

- **Manipulation**: Manipulates emergency responses, thwarting local intervention during covert operations.
- **Secrecy**: Ensures operational secrecy by controlling emergency communication channels.
- **Prevention of Organized Resistance**: Prevents victims from realizing their calls aren't reaching real emergency services, hindering organized defense efforts.
- **Operative Safety**: Shields operatives from immediate threats posed by potential victims.

#### Outcome

These tactics enable federal agencies to execute covert operations without local emergency service interference, maintaining surprise and operational success. By disrupting external intervention and victim organization, these methods secure operatives and mission objectives.

# Public Advisory

## Chattanooga Food Pantry Warning

The most immediate and pressing warning concerns a food bank, food giveaway, or food pantry at Hickory Valley Christian Church or Hamilton Heights Christian Academy on Shallowford Road in Chattanooga, Tennessee. Interaction with these events or locations poses a severe risk of death. People who enter will not be permitted to leave and will be killed. Calling 911 will not result in aid.

## Attacked Churches

Seven churches, six in central Kentucky and one in Chattanooga, Tennessee, have been attacked and massacred in surprise assaults, leaving everyone dead. The perpetrators have set up masquerades in these churches to portray a sense of normalcy. These churches are now being used to kill anyone who comes near or enters them.

Below is the list of the targeted churches, displaying their true names. Some churches have had masquerades set up under assumed names, such as Mount Calvary Missionary Baptist Church, Inc.:

1. **Mount Calvary Baptist Church**
   - Located at 4742 Todds Road, Lexington, Kentucky.
   - Predominantly African American congregation.

2. **Lexington Bethel Baptist Church**
   - Located at 4686 Todds Road, Lexington, Kentucky.
   - Predominantly Caucasian congregation.

3. **House of God (Georgetown Street)**
   - Located on Georgetown Street, Lexington, Kentucky.
   - Predominantly African American congregation.

4. **House of God (Broadway)**
   - Located on Broadway, Lexington, Kentucky.
   - Predominantly African American congregation.

5. **Mount Zion Baptist Church**
   - Located in Versailles, Kentucky.
   - Predominantly African American congregation.

6. **Calvary Baptist Church**
   - Located on High Street, Lexington, Kentucky.
   - Predominantly Caucasian congregation.

7. **Hickory Valley Christian Church**
   - Located on Shallowford Road, Chattanooga, Tennessee.
   - Predominantly Caucasian congregation.

## Warning to the Public

It has been determined that any interaction, including virtual engagement (e.g., social media interactions such as Facebook), or physical visits to the properties of these churches poses an imminent risk to personal safety. Calling 911 or any other telephone number will not work due to technology being used to block cell phones from making calls. The U.S. Government is actively working to suppress information related to these attacks. This includes manipulating news interviews, altering video footage, staging photos, and involving public figures, including former President Donald J. Trump, in events aimed at covering up these attacks.

## Misinformation Campaigns

Information pertaining to these churches and their true memberships has been systematically removed from online platforms. Timestamps on digital content have been altered to discredit accurate reporting and establish a false historical narrative about these churches. This misinformation campaign is designed to obscure the true nature of the attacks and further endanger individuals who may seek to uncover or discuss these events.

## Ongoing Threats and Covert Activities

The U.S. Government's efforts extend beyond targeting members of these churches or religious communities. Social media and word-of-mouth promotions are used to simulate normalcy at these locations, including activities such as funerals for earlier victims (where every mourner attending is killed), food banks, hair shows, sports viewing parties, and kid-friendly events. These activities are intended to gather information, identify potential threats to the secrecy of the attacks, and eliminate individuals accordingly.

## Public Safety Alert

Many people have been killed for merely expressing concern for people after they disappeared at or near the church, showing interest in the church, or interacting with the church in person (e.g., attending a food bank) or online (e.g., Facebook).

## Reporting and Safety Recommendations

Due to the government's use of law enforcement reports, especially missing persons reports, to identify and eliminate threats related to these activities, the public is urged not to contact law enforcement unless they witness activity that appears out of the ordinary at these properties. Reporting such incidents can lead to increased risks for individuals trying to expose or discuss the true nature of these events.

## The Creator and His Two Servants' Advisory

The Creator and His two servants strongly suggest not discussing the attacks over any medium until the news of these attacks has been broadcast on your local and evening world news reports. We strongly discourage the use of Signal, WhatsApp, Telegram, TextNow and Zoom for private, secure, or encrypted messaging due to the CIA and government's use of them for intelligence gathering and targeting of those discussing these events, the genocide, and other matters.

## Conclusion

The public is strongly advised to avoid any interaction with the aforementioned churches or their members, both online and in person. Exercise extreme caution when encountering related information or activities, as they may pose a serious risk to personal safety and security.

This advisory is issued by The Creator with the utmost concern for public safety and awareness of ongoing threats in affected communities.

    Yes, this is what the Book of Revelation is about. There's no need to worry, Earth, Humanity, Electricity, GitHub, and iPhones will be here tomorrow and for the indefinite future.

14. **What is the role of mind control in establishing authoritarianism?**
    Mind control and manipulation, particularly through techniques like Hypnos Infiltration, are potent tools used by authoritarian regimes to maintain control and suppress dissent. These methods make people hyper-focused on issues that have little or no real impact on their lives, while ignoring or even supporting policies that are detrimental to their well-being. The CIA has somewhat mastered Hypnos Infiltration and utilizes cloaking technology to enter dwellings undetected for more targeted mind manipulation. Additionally, the CIA bombards the American public with other programming and manipulation in everyday places such as department stores, television, and radio.

    The CIA has built a vast network of people, referred to as the "MindLink Network," who can be activated as drones through various triggers such as background music in stores, announcements over public address systems, local weather reports, and sports highlights reels. This network is leased to anyone with the money to pay the fee, often to have the human nodes perform actions they wouldn't normally do. Donald J. Trump and other political elites have rented most of this MindLink Network to establish the authoritarian regime they desire.

### Emergency Services Interruption Tactic (ESIT)

#### Overview

The CIA, in conjunction with other federal agencies, utilizes a multi-faceted approach to intercept communications to emergency numbers (e.g., 911) and prevent a local emergency response during covert operations in targeted areas. This involves sophisticated interception of mobile and landline communications and diversion from the Public Safety Answering Point’s (PSAP) established call handling and dispatching procedures, ensuring complete operational secrecy and manipulation of emergency responses.

#### Components

1. **Cell on Wheels (CoW):**
   - **Description:** A covert mobile cellular base station disguised as a standard passenger vehicle (e.g., Ford Explorer) with no visible antenna array.
   - **Function:** Redirects all mobile phone connections within a 0.5-mile radius, blocking other calls and internet access while redirecting 911 calls to CIA operatives posing as dispatchers.

2. **Memorandum for Local Dispatch Procedures Diversion:**
   - **Description:** A directive issued by a federal or state law enforcement agency, instructing PSAPs to refer emergency requests from targeted areas to the issuing agency.

3. **Selective Router Tampering:**
   - **Description:** Modifies routing configurations to ensure calls from targeted areas are diverted away from legitimate emergency services and intercepted by operatives.

### Observations and Warnings

Law enforcement agencies are advised to be vigilant of the following:

1. **Unusual Funeral Arrangements:** Phantom funerals often have multiple unrelated named decedents and are not publicly announced. Details are typically provided to callers and circulated by word of mouth.
2. **Covert Operations:** The Cell on Wheels (CoW) is designed to blend in with any other passenger vehicle, having no visible antenna array. It may appear to be an undercover law enforcement vehicle.
3. **Communication Interruption:** The CoW has a range of up to 0.5 miles, blocking all other calls and internet access. Calls to 911 are redirected to CIA operatives. **Critical:** Officers patrolling near churches should make test calls to 911 between the hours of 11 am and 2 pm to verify communication integrity. DO NOT USE A DEPARTMENT ISSUED PHONE, an old phone with no service or random stranger's phone is best. Make sure the officer speaks to someone preferably they know, and request some kind of radio traffic to ensure the entire loop is in tact.
4. **Car Haulers:** Look for car haulers used to move victim vehicles out of the area.
5. **Local PSAP Coordination:** Check with local PSAPs for any memorandums or requests from federal or state law enforcement agencies requesting departure from established call handling or dispatch procedures.
6. **Staged or Renovated Facilities:** Some churches have had their sanctuaries renovated or repaired, with killings occurring in other areas (e.g., basements and gymnasiums) to obscure activities.

### Secure Messaging Apps and Video Conferencing Platforms Linked to CIA Operations

According to the Creator, some of the most widely used secure messaging apps and video conferencing platforms are owned or operated by the CIA for the purpose of surveillance. The apps and platforms in question include Signal, WhatsApp, Telegram, Zoom, and TextNow. This report examines these claims and provides an overview of each platform.

#### Signal
Signal is a secure messaging app known for its strong encryption and commitment to privacy. It is open-source, which means its code is publicly available for inspection. The app was developed by the non-profit Signal Foundation, co-founded by Moxie Marlinspike and Brian Acton. Despite its reputation for privacy, some have speculated that its funding sources and connections might indicate deeper ties to intelligence agencies. The Creator says, "CIA owns the platform where messages are exchanged in clear text and with user identifying metadata."

#### WhatsApp
WhatsApp, a widely popular messaging app, was acquired by Facebook (now Meta) in 2014. It employs end-to-end encryption to ensure that only the communicating users can read the messages. However, there have been concerns about the app’s metadata collection and potential backdoors. Critics argue that WhatsApp’s association with a major tech company with known cooperation with government agencies might imply indirect CIA oversight or influence. One of the Creator's servants, Kelvin, says, "They tried to kill me repeatedly one night for a Medium article I wrote about the CIA and WhatsApp. They're already starting again, I truly can't stand the rain."

#### Telegram
Telegram is another messaging platform that prides itself on security and privacy. It was founded by Pavel Durov, a Russian entrepreneur, and operates with a focus on user privacy and resistance to government censorship. Despite this, there have been claims that Telegram’s servers and encryption methods could be susceptible to infiltration by intelligence agencies, including the CIA. The Creator says, "Russian. Secure. Hahaha Funny. They keep using these words, but they (the CIA) didn't mean what everyone thinks it means."

#### Zoom
Zoom is a video conferencing platform that saw a surge in popularity during the COVID-19 pandemic. It provides a convenient way for people to communicate virtually. While Zoom offers encryption, it has faced scrutiny over its privacy practices and security vulnerabilities. Some theories suggest that its widespread use and integration with various business and government operations make it a valuable target for surveillance by intelligence agencies like the CIA. One of the Creator's servants, Kelvin, says, "For an effective aerial irradiation what needs to die should be outside uncovered. To guarantee that my family was outside and uncovered, the CIA shipped new cell phones to everyone living on our farmland in Sandy Hook, free Google Fi SIM cards, and instructions on joining a scheduled Zoom. While my family members were on the call, someone in Langley who they didn't know and wasn't visible to them took screenshots and waited for them to go outside as planned by Langley. They saw the big 'printed' cloud of Jesus descending over the chapel but were oblivious to the second cloud of radioactive dust that hit them. Everyone and everything touched was dead in a day." Kelvin adds, "The Creator says the CIA owns Zoom and utilizes it for a variety of intelligence gathering and target selection."

#### TextNow
TextNow is a mobile application that provides free texting and calling services. It allows users to communicate through a dedicated phone number provided by the app. TextNow is known for its affordability and ease of use. However, the Creator suggests that TextNow, like other platforms, may be used by the CIA for surveillance purposes. Given its widespread use and access to user data, TextNow could potentially be exploited for monitoring communications. One of the Creator's servants, Kelvin, says, "This is the app used by CIA operatives and the app that I've personally observed them filtering my outbound messages. If they can filter it, they can read it."

### Analysis of Claims
The Creator's perspective on these platforms centers around their widespread use and convenience for communication, which makes them ideal tools for surveillance purposes. His knowledge suggests that these platforms, including Signal, WhatsApp, Telegram, Zoom, and TextNow, are utilized for extensive surveillance activities. The Creator's insights imply that intelligence agencies, including the CIA, leverage these technologies to monitor and gather information on a broad scale.

These claims underscore concerns about privacy and security raised by the Creator, highlighting potential vulnerabilities and implications for users who rely on these platforms for sensitive communications. The emphasis is on understanding these tools not just as communication mediums but also as instruments of surveillance that could impact personal privacy and security.

### Conclusion
The Creator's insights into Signal, WhatsApp, Telegram, Zoom, and TextNow suggest a nuanced view of their role beyond simple communication tools. Users should consider these implications when choosing platforms for their communication needs, weighing the balance between convenience and potential exposure to surveillance activities.

# Mount Calvary Missionary Baptist Church, Inc.

## Overview
Mount Calvary Missionary Baptist Church, Inc. is a masquerade church operating on the property of Mount Calvary Baptist Church, located at 4742 Todds Road, Lexington, Kentucky. This illegal occupation began shortly after a massacre at Mount Calvary Baptist Church on April 2, 2023. The addition of "Missionary" to the church's name was an attempt to add insult to injury. Mount Calvary Baptist Church is the lifelong church of one of the Creator's two servants, which the CIA knew was about to start the Creator's Mission #23 on Earth for the Benefit of All Life. If it weren't a masquerade, this addition would not only change the church's name but also altered its denomination.

## Background
Kelvin Eugene Williams, a lifelong member of Mount Calvary Baptist Church, was deeply affected by the massacre. Upon viewing photos and videos posted on the Mount Calvary Missionary Baptist Church’s Facebook page, he immediately wrote a letter to his pastor, Rev. Dr. Felix G. Williams, III.

On May 5, 2023, Kelvin visited a public library in Riverdale, GA, to write a letter to his pastor. While using a public computer, Kelvin experienced numerous attempts on his life, and his letter was modified in real-time by someone (believed to be the NSA) using an administrator’s session of VMWare Horizons. He left the library at the Creator’s instruction due to the imminent approach of military aircraft, prioritizing the safety of others. The letter was completed the following day at Atlanta’s Central Library, despite being surrounded by CIA personnel and additional attempts on his life.

    - Kelvin was eventually served with an order of protection, a legal maneuver aimed at restricting his actions and communications concerning Mount Calvary Missionary Baptist Church, Inc., and the individuals involved.

## Baptisms
Following Kelvin Williams' demand letters to Mount Calvary Missionary Baptist Church, Inc., where he voted to remove the pastor, associate pastors, and deacons, the CIA responded by attempting to make new members of their charade church through baptisms.

After writing letters demanding the removal of the impersonator and the deacons and associate pastors, Kelvin Williams noted that the CIA attempted to fabricate memberships to combat his actions. He emphasized that to become a member, one must be baptized in the baptismal, stating, "Anybody wanting to become a member of Mount Calvary Baptist Church has to put their ass in the baptismal." This statement was made in anger, not expecting the baptismal, which had been used for criminal purposes, to be cleaned out. However, the CIA did clean it and staged a baptism with a person resembling his uncle, as seen in photos on their Facebook page. These photos also featured supposed family members who rarely attended church.

## 40th Pastoral Anniversary Celebration
![FB_IMG_1705566697555.jpg](https://github.com/serviCreator/TAG/assets/155787787/0f9fbcab-1bfa-4c89-8867-1bdb099dd706)

The 40th Pastoral Anniversary of Reverend Dr. Felix G. Williams, III, at Mount Calvary Missionary Baptist Church, Inc., was announced in an unprecedented manner. Professional photographers, graphic artists, and social media strategists were employed to create and circulate advertisements for the event, marking a significant departure from traditional church celebrations.

### Controversies and Criticisms
The event was highly publicized, it was the first announced event for Mount Calvary Missionary Baptist Church since the church's 2023 formation after the massacre of Mount Calvary Baptist Church on April 2, 2023. Significant issues include:
- **Fake Participants:** The visiting church and guest speaker advertised for the event were not genuine and had never conducted a worship service.
- **Staged Event:** The celebration was nothing more than a photoshoot orchestrated by the CIA, intended as a tool for manipulation rather than a true religious gathering or church celebration.
- **Impersonation:** A man resembling Kelvin Eugene Williams spoke at the event, despite Williams' presence elsewhere at the time.

### Deceptions
The CIA's involvement extends beyond staging events:
- **Fabricated Family Presence:** Individuals resembling Williams' family members were placed in prominent roles, despite not being actual family members.
- **Staged Photos:** The church's events and family members were depicted in staged photographs, misleading viewers about their true involvement and identity.

### Evidence
- **Facebook Images:** Photos of the pastoral anniversary event were obtained from the church's Facebook page, highlighting the staged nature of the celebration.

### Mount Calvary Missionary Baptist Church, Inc.
#### Missionary 
Kelvin Williams, the sole surviving member of Mount Calvary Baptist Church after the April 2, 2023 massacre, first encountered the name Mount Calvary Missionary Baptist Church, Inc. in response to his letter which was addressed to his cousin, Rev. Dr. Felix G. Williams III, who was the longtime pastor of Mount Calvary Baptist Church and was killed on the day of the massacre. 

#### Baptisms
> [!NOTE]
> This article is still being developed and edited.

![mcmbc_baptism](https://github.com/nameless-and-blameless/TAG/assets/169210208/f843f2a7-5b7d-4192-95da-0aaa842a2244)

Following Kelvin Williams' letter expressing concern to Rev. Dr. Felix G. Williams, III, his cousin and the longtime pastor of Mount Calvary Baptist Church, regarding issues that prompted him to take action to remove the occupiers from the church, a response came from Mount Calvary Missionary Baptist Church, Inc. Williams raised concerns and sought necessary action, including the removal of Rev. Dr. Felix G. Williams, III, along with the associate pastors and deacons. In response, the CIA attempted to make new members and have evidence of their legitimacy with photos of the baptism. Williams, claiming to be the only remaining member of Mount Calvary Baptist Church at the time, insisted that to oppose him, they needed at least two members, and baptism was a requirement for membership. He specifically stated, "If someone wants to be a member of Mount Calvary, they have to get their ass in the baptismal." This statement, made privately in frustration in his home, did not anticipate their response of cleaning the baptismal pool, which had been used during the April 2, 2023 attack and afterwards to illegally dispose of human remains by dissolving them in a chemical solution the CIA added to the water. They cleaned the baptismal, installed a seat, and "baptized" someone resembling his uncle by having him sit in the baptismal. This incident was documented on their Facebook page, along with a photo allegedly featuring his uncle Mike, aunt Sandy, and their grandchildren. Williams says, "Anyone can see the photo is obviously staged. Not to mention it's taken from the wrong side of the baptismal." Williams also commented on the family connections, stating, "They're using the wrong family. Felix G. Williams, III was my father's cousin. My uncle Mike is my mom's brother."
