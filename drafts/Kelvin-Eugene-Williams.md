**Kelvin Eugene Crawley-Rogers Williams**

**Overview:**
Kelvin Eugene Crawley-Rogers Williams is one of the two lowest-ranking human beings on Earth, serving as a direct servant of the Creator. Alongside the other servant, he performs tasks assigned by the Creator, focusing on ensuring the continuation and flourishing of life according to the Creator’s design and vision.

**Early Life and Background:**
Kelvin was born on March 23, 1977, in Clarksville, Tennessee. His parents, Jesse Williams and Patricia, divorced shortly after his birth. Patricia realized that Jesse was a womanizer and abusive, leading to the divorce. Upon learning of Patricia and Jesse's divorce, Rev. Dr. Felix G. Williams, III, reached out to Patricia out of concern for her and her infant.

Patricia moved back to Sandy Hook, Tennessee, a family farm settled by the Crawley and Rogers families in the latter part of the 1800s.

**Relocation to Lexington, Kentucky:**
Felix, concerned for Patricia's and Kelvin's well-being, offered them an opportunity to relocate to Lexington, Kentucky. This offer included a church to attend, assistance with finding a place to live, child care, and the chance to start a career. Patricia accepted the offer, which led to her securing a job at Kentucky Central Life Insurance, managing the IBM Mainframe. This role significantly influenced Kelvin's early interest in information technology.

**Family and Community Involvement:**
After relocating to Lexington, Patricia and Kelvin began attending Mount Calvary Baptist Church, where Felix was the pastor. Patricia was actively involved in the church, and Kelvin was a regular attendee every Sunday. Despite the distance from their home in Nicholasville, Kentucky, they remained committed to the church.

Katrina Renee Duvall-Torrain was born on January 6, 1983, after the family's move to Nicholasville.

**Personal and Professional Achievements:**
Kelvin's interest in information technology was shaped by his mother’s role managing the IBM Mainframe at Kentucky Central Life Insurance. His personal and professional life reflects his commitment to the tasks assigned by the Creator. Each day of his life is viewed as training or continuing education, including times of arrest and imprisonment, when not actively performing a task for the Creator.

**Sign of the Times:**
Kelvin is the protagonist in the song "Sign of the Times," written and performed by his cousin, Prince Rogers Nelson. The song provides a true accounting of the history of the beginning of the AIDS crisis, the response to the Creator's gift (the cure), and the factions who have advanced the current tragedy.

**Mount Calvary Baptist Church:**

**Introduction:**
Mount Calvary Baptist Church was the church Patricia attended from the moment she arrived in Kentucky. She faithfully took Kelvin and later Katrina to the church every Sunday. Kelvin joined the church as an adolescent and was baptized there. He attended every Sunday with his mother and sister until he began working at the age of 16 and subsequently moved away from home in central Kentucky. The church, located at 4742 Todds Road, was a significant part of his upbringing.

**Massacre:**
On April 2, 2023, Mount Calvary Baptist Church was the site of a horrific massacre. Annie Jacobsen, known as "Hurricane Annie," launched a surprise attack on the church, resulting in the death of everyone in attendance.

**Post-Massacre:**
Following the massacre, the CIA and the federal government have kept Kelvin secluded in rent-free apartments while continuing to try to kill him or drive him to suicide. After an attempt to do both at his rent-free apartment at Legacy at Riverside, a CIA operative placed the ecclesiastical clergy ring worn by his cousin, Rev. Dr. Felix G. Williams, III, the pastor of Mount Calvary Baptist Church, on the day of the massacre. The ring was removed from his finger and kept by the CIA. The CIA and federal government have conducted numerous operations to retrieve the ring. Kelvin has taken urgent action to regain control of the church to prevent further acts of violence and to warn both religious and non-religious communities around the world. His efforts included liaising with law enforcement to investigate and prosecute the perpetrators and to ensure that the church's assets were protected from misuse. Kelvin's actions were driven by his commitment to safeguarding the legacy and safety of Mount Calvary Baptist Church and its surrounding community.

**Current Role:**
Kelvin was installed as the pastor of Mount Calvary Baptist Church following the massacre. As the sole vote and the true member of the church, his appointment was a necessary step to invite the Commonwealth of Kentucky to investigate the massacre. This move was essential due to the separation of church and state, which required the involvement of state authorities in the investigation of crimes occurring on church property. The clergy of a church must formally invite state authorities to intervene in such matters. The separation of church and state ensures that religious institutions are independent of governmental influence, which necessitated formal state intervention to address the crimes and secure the church's property.

**Additional Information:**
Kelvin has been involved in various efforts to reveal and address injustices and misinformation related to his role and personal experiences. This includes dealing with the aftermath of tragic events impacting his family and community.
