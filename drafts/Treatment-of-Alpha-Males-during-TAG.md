# Report: Early Phases of The American Genocide and the Targeting of Alpha Males

## Introduction
During the initial phases of The American Genocide, a systematic effort was undertaken by the CIA to eliminate perceived threats to Gilead Sciences posed by the Creator's forthcoming product, Spark. Spark, capable of correcting a human DNA error and thus presenting a revolutionary cure, was seen as a critical threat to the pharmaceutical industry. As the CIA worked to neutralize this risk, they began to interrogate and exploit the associates of the Creator’s servant in deeply invasive ways. This led to the targeting and eventual exploitation of a specific group of males based on physical characteristics, particularly penile length.

## CIA Interrogations and the Targeting of Alpha Males

### Questioning Associates of the Creator's Servant
In an effort to eliminate the risk Spark posed to Gilead Sciences, the CIA initiated aggressive interrogations of the Creator’s servant's associates. These interviews, initially focused on gathering intelligence regarding potential risks, quickly shifted to a deeply invasive line of questioning. The CIA determined that His servant's large penis gave him a perceived advantage within the HIV-positive gay male community, potentially facilitating conversations about HIV and giving him the opportunity to provide early access to Spark.

As a result, the CIA fixated on the size of the Creator’s servant’s penis. This invasive line of questioning was weaponized to profile the associates and members of the gay community who had any knowledge of His servant's size. This inquiry was aimed at neutralizing the social advantage that the servant’s penis size could confer, especially in engaging and gaining trust within the HIV-positive population.

### Expansion of Targeting Based on Physical Attributes
After determining that His servant’s physical attribute could aid in the dissemination of Spark, the CIA expanded its investigation to include self-reported data from associates of the Creator’s servant. CIA operatives began to directly question interviewees about their own physical attributes, using this data to classify males who had penile lengths of seven inches or longer as "alpha males." These men were marked for special targeting due to their potential influence or threat.

As part of their broader efforts to mitigate the perceived threat posed by Spark, the CIA began systematically adding males to the target group based on the physical information obtained during these interviews. Eventually, the scope of the targeting expanded to include the broader associate network of the Creator’s servant, as well as individuals within the gay communities of multiple cities.

## The CIA's Methods of Mitigation

### Subconscious Manipulation via Hypnos Infiltration Method
To mitigate the perceived advantage of His servant’s physical attribute, the CIA sought to manipulate his subconscious. They employed the Hypnos Infiltration Method, a psychological technique designed to influence and disrupt an individual’s mental state while they slept. By engaging with His servant’s subconscious, the CIA hoped to diminish the influence of his size within the gay community and hinder his ability to foster early access to Spark among HIV-positive males.

### Smear Campaigns and Community Disruption
In addition to subconscious manipulation, the CIA initiated smear campaigns within the gay communities of several cities. These campaigns focused on spreading misinformation and arbitrary measurements concerning the size of His servant’s penis. The purpose of these efforts was twofold:
1. **Discredit His servant’s influence** by undermining his standing in the gay community.
2. **Create a network of informants** who could relay information about associates and individuals aware of His servant’s physical size.

The CIA deemed it necessary to identify the number of associates and gay community members in various cities who were aware of His servant’s relative size. This data was used to further target those who might help spread knowledge of Spark or offer support to the Creator's servant.

## Exploitation of Alpha Males

### Forced Pornographic Production and Sexual Exploitation
As part of the operation to eliminate the influence of alpha males, the CIA systematically coerced, enticed, or outright forced individuals in the target group to produce pornographic material. These materials primarily consisted of solo masturbation videos or homosexual acts, despite many of the men identifying as heterosexual with no history of homosexual behavior. These men were not only exploited for these materials but also used as lures or rewards for other operatives in the network.

### Kidnapping and Sexual Servitude
Several of the males in the target group were kidnapped and held against their will. In these instances, they were subjected to forced sexual activity and exploited as payment or rewards for CIA operatives and informants. These men, once viewed as threats due to their alpha status, were degraded, sexually violated, and eventually eliminated after they had served their purpose.

### Elimination of the Target Group
The CIA’s goal was the complete mitigation of all males classified as alpha males. After being sexually exploited and their bodies and physical traits weaponized for the regime’s purposes, many of these men were killed. Their elimination was seen as necessary to prevent any further dissemination of Spark or potential threats to the authoritarian regime’s control.

## Conclusion
The early phases of The American Genocide, initially focused on neutralizing the threat that Spark posed to Gilead Sciences, devolved into a politically driven campaign of exploitation, manipulation, and brutality. The targeting of alpha males, based on the invasive assessment of their physical attributes, illustrates the extreme lengths the CIA and political interests were willing to go in their efforts to establish and maintain control. The CIA’s use of psychological manipulation, smear campaigns, and sexual exploitation stands as a chilling example of the regime’s violent authoritarian agenda.
