# Report: The Treatment of Alpha Males During The American Genocide

## Introduction
During The American Genocide, a distinct group of males was identified, targeted, and systematically eliminated based on specific physical characteristics. One of the primary criteria for selection was penile length, with those measuring seven inches or longer being classified as "alpha males." This classification became a basis for their dehumanization, exploitation, and eventual eradication.

## Targeting Criteria
Males who were classified as alpha males were identified through invasive methods, including medical examinations, surveillance, or coercive interrogations. This group was specifically singled out due to perceptions of dominance, physical prowess, and sexual viability. Penile length was weaponized as a measure of status, and those who met the criteria were considered a potential threat to the social and political control exerted by the ruling elite.

## Forced Participation in Pornographic Materials
A significant portion of the males in the alpha category were coerced, manipulated, or outright forced into creating pornographic content. This content, primarily in video form, was distributed as part of a larger network of exploitation, used both as a means of control and as blackmail against those involved.

Many of these males, who had no prior history of engaging in the adult film industry, were lured with false promises of freedom, financial gain, or leniency. In other cases, violence or threats against their loved ones were used to force compliance. The exploitation of their bodies was often a precursor to further violence and degradation.

## Sexual Coercion and Assault
Once categorized, many alpha males were subjected to forced sexual activity. While some of this activity occurred between males and females, there was a significant number of cases where heterosexual males were forced into homosexual acts. This was a deliberate tactic used to humiliate and further degrade these individuals, many of whom had no prior history or inclination toward homosexual behavior.

These coerced acts were often recorded as part of the pornographic material, or used as a form of blackmail against other males or operatives within the genocidal framework. For many, the forced participation in such acts represented the final stage of their physical and psychological destruction before they were eliminated.

## Kidnapping and Forced Sexual Exploitation
The targeting of alpha males did not stop at mere exploitation. Many were kidnapped and held against their will in clandestine locations. Here, they were repeatedly abused and used as tools to further the goals of the genocide. In some instances, these men were used as "lures" to entrap other males or females, or as "rewards" for operatives involved in genocidal activities. Others were offered as payment for services rendered, forced into ongoing sexual servitude until they were ultimately discarded and killed.

The conditions of their captivity were often brutal, with inadequate food, sleep deprivation, and constant physical and sexual abuse. For many, death was seen as a relief from the suffering they endured.

## Mitigation of the Alpha Males
The eventual goal of the program was the complete mitigation of all males who fell into the alpha classification. Once their usefulness—whether for pornographic material, forced sexual labor, or other purposes—was exhausted, they were systematically eliminated. The methods of elimination ranged from public executions designed to send a message to others, to secretive disappearances where bodies were never recovered.

The genocidal program viewed these men as a threat to the existing power structures, and their physical attributes, once a source of strength, became a target for their downfall. In the final stages, the eradication of alpha males was seen as a necessary step to secure the political and social goals of those in power.

## Conclusion
The treatment of alpha males during The American Genocide was marked by extreme sexual violence, exploitation, and ultimate elimination. This group, identified solely by their physical characteristics, was stripped of their humanity, degraded through forced participation in pornographic and sexual activities, and subjected to severe physical and psychological abuse. Their elimination was seen not just as an act of violence, but as a deliberate strategy to assert control and suppress potential opposition.
