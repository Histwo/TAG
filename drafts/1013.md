Documentation of Involuntary Psychiatric Hold and Related Events

Incident Dates: October 8 - October 24, 2024

Locations:

Phoenix House: 1296 Murphy Ave SW, Atlanta, GA 30310

Georgia Regional Hospital (Panthersville Campus): 3073 Panthersville Rd, Decatur, GA 30034

1. Summary of Initial Incident (October 8, 2024)

Event: In the early morning hours of October 8, I threw a thermos, which caused additional damage to a previously broken and unrepaired window at Phoenix House.

Context: This action was the result of the Hypnos Infiltration Method, a technique reportedly used by CIA personnel within my dwelling while I was asleep. The method was employed to deliver subconscious instructions that led me to cause an outburst with the potential to initiate a 1013 hold. Importantly, the original window damage had occurred almost two months prior and had been reported to Phoenix House staff, yet they exhibited no concern for my mental health at the time and did not pursue any intervention through police or Mobile Crisis. Despite their knowledge of the damage, the window remained unrepaired and unattended.

2. Police and Mobile Crisis Intervention (October 9, 2024)

Police Contact: On the morning of October 9, Phoenix House staff contacted the police in an attempt to initiate a 1013 involuntary psychiatric hold.

Response: The officers who arrived stated that they were unable to authorize a 1013 hold.


Mobile Crisis Team: Following the police response, Phoenix House staff then called the Mobile Crisis Team for further evaluation.

Interaction with Crisis Team: The crisis team briefly spoke with me, then initiated a video call with a woman driving at the time. After a short conversation, she ordered a 1013 hold.

Observed and Reported Behavior: During this interaction, nothing in my observed behavior or my statements justified a 1013. I was neither a risk to myself nor others, was not hallucinating, and expressed only my frustration over what I felt were repeated privacy invasions.

3. Hospital Admission and Psychiatric Hold at Grady Memorial Hospital (October 9 - October 16, 2024)

Admission: After the 1013 hold order, I was transported by ambulance to Grady Memorial Hospital’s Emergency Room, where I was initially held in the psychiatric unit until around 2 a.m.

Observation on 13th Floor: I was transferred to an observation room on the 13th floor, where I remained for almost a week.

Daily Psychiatric Evaluations: I saw psychiatrists daily following my admission.

Initiation of 1014 Hold: After several days in the observation unit, I was informed that a 1014 hold had been initiated without prior notice.

My Condition During Hold: During this period, my behavior remained stable, involving only routine activities like sleeping and eating, and no psychiatric issues were observed or noted by the staff.



Communication with Hospital Staff Regarding Family:

Discussion of Family Contact: During my stay, a social worker and psychiatrist informed me that they had spoken with my mother.

Clarification Provided: I explained that such a conversation would have been impossible, as my mother had been murdered in October 2022.

Response from Psychiatrist: Upon hearing this, the psychiatrist abruptly ended our conversation and left the observation room without further discussion or evaluation of additional patients.

4. Transfer to Georgia Regional Hospital (October 16 - October 24, 2024)

Admission and 1014 Hold Notification: Upon my arrival at Georgia Regional Hospital’s Panthersville campus, the admitting psychiatrist informed me that I would be held under the 1014 issued from Grady for the legally required four business days.

Unit Psychiatrist’s Evaluation of 1021 Hold: Once I was placed on a unit, the unit psychiatrist advised me that he would be pursuing a 1021 hold, which would require my appearance in a civil proceeding. However, he expressed concern, noting that I did not exhibit any symptoms or behavior that would typically justify a 1021 hold. For me, this was evidence of the true nature of my hold, as they were pursuing a longer hold without any clinical justification. This was consistent with the report from Grady personnel regarding conversations with someone impersonating my mother.

Appendix (Optional)

Overview of Georgia Involuntary Hold Statutes (1013, 1014, and 1021):

Summary of each statute and their criteria for involuntary psychiatric holds, highlighting any inconsistencies with the circumstances surrounding my own holds.
