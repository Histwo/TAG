**Unveiling the Hidden Genocide: The Conductor and Composer of Darkness**

In an alarming revelation, an intricate web of deceit and corruption has come to light, exposing a chilling conspiracy within the United States. Central to this dark affair are former President Donald J. Trump and Annie Jacobsen, a CIA operative and psychological warfare expert, known in her circles as "Hurricane Annie." This conspiracy has resulted in a widespread genocide, with a network of high-profile individuals implicated in the cover-up.

**The Unfolding Tragedy**

The current tragedy, which has evolved into a full-fledged genocide, has left Kelvin Eugene Crawley-Rogers Williams, one of the Creator's two servants, without any family, friends, or work associates from his long career. Kelvin is now the only living member of Mount Calvary Baptist Church in Lexington, Kentucky, where 127 victims were massacred on April 2, 2023. Despite this immense loss, Kelvin remains committed to the Creator's mission for all human life. He continues to be a key figure, even being the protagonist in the song "Sign of the Times" by his cousin, Prince.

Following the Mount Calvary massacre, the CIA attempted to sell the church property through Sotheby’s Atlanta. When the sale failed, they began holding funerals and providing funeral arrangements to lure in victims, their families, and loved ones, only to kill them upon arrival. This led to attacks on neighboring churches, including Lexington Bethel Baptist Church, which was targeted after its congregation noticed unusual activity at Mount Calvary. The delegation from Bethel Baptist found impersonators at Mount Calvary and was subsequently targeted by Jacobsen.

Similar tactics were employed at the House of God on Georgetown Street, which was attacked after a member went missing. The organist and minister of music from Mount Calvary was a key figure there. When concerns arose at the House of God on Broadway, that church was also attacked. These attacks were meticulously managed by Dennis Taylor, a surrogate of Jacobsen. Mount Zion Baptist Church in Georgetown, Kentucky, and Hickory Valley Christian Church in Chattanooga, Tennessee, were also attacked, with over 1,000 members murdered on Mother’s Day at Hickory Valley. The commandeered churches were used to host mock services, funerals, and community events, luring victims with the intent to kill them.

Trump has directed numerous cover-up operations, including media interviews at the phantom funeral of Reverend Dr. Duke Stone, the former pastor of Hickory Valley Christian Church. At this event, where every mourner was killed, Trump and Jacobsen engaged in sexual activities in the motorcade before entering the funeral. Trump also provided interviews with local news to discredit any reporting by the Creator and His servants, using the videos to falsely claim that he attended and left safely.

Trump and Jacobsen frequently visit Phoenix House, located at 1296 Murphy Avenue in Atlanta. This CIA-run facility provides a rent-free apartment for Kelvin Eugene Crawley-Rogers Williams, used to isolate him from the public and his work for the Creator, perform hypnosis infiltration methods while he is sleeping, and as a controlled environment for potential killing. They often enter his apartment using microwave cloaking technology, rendering them invisible in hopes of watching him die. Additionally, another apartment at Phoenix House serves as a hidden love nest for Trump and Jacobsen.

**The Creator’s Perspective**

The Creator cites speed-induced paranoia as the reason why this tragedy, stemming from one of His gifts to the human race, has turned into a full-fledged genocide. This genocide is noted as the first instance of such an atrocity against a non-indigenous people on the American continent.

**Call for Accountability**

The Creator has identified seven individuals who must be imprisoned for their roles in this genocide and the ongoing cover-up operation that continues to claim human lives. These individuals are:

1. Former President Donald J. Trump
2. Annie Jacobsen
3. Michael Blackmon
4. President Joseph Biden
5. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi
6. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell
7. CIA Director William Burns

This unfolding crisis demands immediate scrutiny and intervention to prevent further loss of life and to hold accountable those responsible for these egregious violations of human rights. The need for transparency and justice has never been more urgent.
