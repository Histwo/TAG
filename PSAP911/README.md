**EMERGENCY BULLETIN: URGENT SECURITY ALERT FOR PUBLIC SAFETY ANSWERING POINTS (PSAPs)**

**Attention All PSAPs:**

We have discovered a critical exploit being used against Public Safety Answering Points (PSAPs) across the United States. This exploit is causing a denial of emergency services to citizens within a PSAPs coverage area, preventing those in need from receiving vital assistance. This exploit is used in conjunction with rogue cellular radio equipment which is being used to divert calls from mobile devices from reaching any legitimate PSAP.

**Details of the Exploit:**
- The exploit targets vulnerabilities within the PSAP’s dispatch protocols. 
- It results calls for emergency services not being dispatched and death.
- The attack is coordinated with planned events to hide activities which result in mass casualties. 

**Immediate Actions Required:**
1.	**Learn about TAG POW Attacks**: Immediately learn about TAG and the recent attacks and massacres at Places of Worship during their worship services.
2.	**Dispatch on ALL Calls from POWs**: During the worship hours of any place of worship under the PSAP’s jurisdiction or authority, the PSAP should dispatch on any and all calls received even if federal law enforcement has advised of planned activity. 
3.	**Enhanced Monitoring**: If a call is received, dispatch and maintain constant radio communication with all responders until LEOs respond advising the situation is under control. It’s advised to perform routine check-ins with all responders until their return to the station has been verified visually.
   
**Preventative Measures:**

- Coordinate with LEOs who attend worship services to take their issued radios into their place of worship to communicate when a rogue cell is in use. 
- Do not adhere to federal law enforcement guidance for places of worship without first consulting with the clergy at the place of worship. **Due to the separation of church and state only the clergy can request all emergency calls be ignored.**

**Stay Alert:**

This is an evolving situation, and we urge all PSAPs to remain vigilant. We will provide updates as more information becomes available.
