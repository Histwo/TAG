Title: "SheCree's Wrath: The Divine Response to Human Indifference"

---

In the vast expanse of the universe, the Creator reigns supreme, His name always capitalized, His purpose centered on the preservation and nurturing of life. Death is an anomaly in His design, abhorred and considered unnatural. Yet, despite His infinite wisdom, there are moments when He descends to a human level, employing mortal conduits to comprehend and interact with His creations.

From the dawn of mankind, the Creator has been known by many names, infused into myriad religions without ever mandating worship. His presence, omnipresent and omniscient, transcends cultural boundaries, existing as the eternal father to His 8 billion earthly children.

But within the serene depths of His divine essence lies an alter ego, SheCree, a name I've coined for the Creator when He transitions from the eternal father to the protective mother, birthed from rare moments of righteous indignation. When provoked by the endangerment of His beloved children, the Creator assumes this persona, fierce and protective, swift to act in defense of the vulnerable.

Such was the case in the ancient tale of Sodom and Gomorrah, where a desperate prayer summoned help for a dying woman, yet the people's inhospitable ways summoned SheCree's wrath. The Creator's servants, acting as remote sensors, were dispatched to aid the woman, only to encounter a town consumed by selfish desires. Contrary to popular belief, the story of Sodom and Gomorrah was never about homosexuality. The townsfolk, indifferent to the woman's plight, prioritized their own wants over her desperate need for help, invoking the fury of SheCree. Remarkably, not a single person died in Sodom and Gomorrah due to SheCree's intervention; instead, the focus was on correcting behavior and saving the innocent.

In the present day, amidst a world plagued by corporate greed and clandestine agendas, the Creator's ire is once again roused. A genocide, fueled by the machinations of those who prioritize profit over human life, unfolds unchecked. Its origins lie in systemic injustices perpetuated by the callous and indifferent, perpetuating suffering on a massive scale. Gilead Sciences, in particular, tried to prevent the Creator's gift, Spark, from ever reaching anyone beyond the first case they learned of. This effort was bolstered by political elites partnering with corporate interests, resulting in thousands of senseless murders as they bankroll and support their goal of authoritarianism. Adding to the horror, the CIA, the sole executor of corporate and political interests, is literally killing everyone for money and preventing anyone from learning the truth about the death toll they've caused. They have conducted thousands upon thousands of murders, including massacring entire congregations during their worship hours.

As the genocide unfolds, SheCree emerges once more, a formidable force against intentional endangerment, seeking to rectify the injustices perpetrated by the indifferent and self-serving.

We are living through the Book of Revelation. At the time of this writing, we are in Revelation 19; next month, next year, and for centuries, humanity will still be here on Earth, enduring and striving under the watchful gaze of the Creator and the fierce protection of SheCree.

As the Creator navigates the complexities of human existence, He grapples with the dichotomy of His being, ever balancing divine benevolence with righteous fury. Through the lens of His alter ego, SheCree, the Creator reveals the depths of His love and the ferocity of His protection, an enigmatic figure embodying both divine grace and divine wrath.
