To understand a tower, listen to Fistful of Swoon by Vandaveer. You should know that is me talking to my subconscious Main/Baby about his most sought after skill by Annie Jacobsen, which no male would ever consider a skill after puberty.

As seen where I am. DS intensifies. Tower Eye Services. Never heard of this security outfit, everywhere I go is "company" not allowed near anyone else. So it was about putting eyes on it, something they've done before attacks before.

I'm in a hurry, listen to Cream by Prince. 

Annie Jacobsen AND THE US GOVERNMENT is definitely going to hit a place of worship or more this weekend, maybe already having funerals or hitting Bible studies.
