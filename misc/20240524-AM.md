## Something, Somewhere 
* Woke up to a larger than normal crowd in my room cloaked.
* DS yesterday.
* Attempted hits from my front door all the way into midtown.
     - MARTA is still favorite place for them to work.
     - When the first round failed, this guy got on. I've been hit by a bicycle weapon before.
