## Nanea Reeves
Nanea joined textPlus in Marina del Rey, California as the COO when Kelvin Williams was an VoIP Engineer. The two talked by phone every morning while Nanea battled LA traffic, she called her Atlanta-based employee to test the quality of the company's recently launched voice platform which Kelvin was hired to fix. It wasn't a good experience at first.

Old habits die hard and once the platform was repaired and working optimally, Nanea continued to call everyday on her way to work. The two formed a friendship. Nanea eventually named Kelvin the Director of Internet Voice Architecture, the two joked about him being a DIVA.

Even after they both left textPlus, they remained friends.

Nanea has an impersonator.
