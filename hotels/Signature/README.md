The most valuable hotel in the CIA's portfolio is priceless to the CIA and the US federal government is the one named after my mother, Patricia Ann Rogers Crawley Williams. The hotel is based in what was Sandy Hook, Tennessee an unincorporated city in Maury County.

"If the song "Raspberry Beret" by my cousin Prince Rogers Nelson had another couple verses you would have learned what happened after the visit to Old Man Johnson's farm (that was on Johnson Hill Road) by Josie Rogers (from West Sheepneck Road) and Lila Crawley (from [Crawley Hill Road](crawley_hill.md))--the birth of my mother the baby girl for both parents who just had a quick horsebarn hookup," says Kelvin Williams.

Both the CIA and the US federal government need this hotel to remain operational so they can divest themselves of the farm most in middle Tennessee knew as Sandy Hook, an unincorporated city in Maury county, that the only living decedent, Kelvin Williams, of the Rogers and Crawley families would inherit according to both family tradition, wills and Tennessee probate law. (See ["Alphabet Street"](README.md#alphabet-street)

What happened in Sandy Hook had to be hidden from the world, so the CIA has been very busy trying to steal everything. The CIA felt it necessary to massacre Mount Calvary Baptist Church in Lexington, KY where Patricia raised her two children and was a longtime member.

Sandy Hook is home to another church connected to Patricia, Orr Chapel, which stood across from her spot on the family farm was destroyed by a developer and the family's cemetery was dug up and pulverized. When the church's members discovered it, the CIA identified them and killed them and others related to them throughout Maury county.

### Alphabet Street 
An Alphabet Street is technically any cemetery with headstones because as you walk along a row of graves the alphabet will dance alongside you (on the headstones). My family, multiple churches (one now missing), several funeral homes, maps, genealogy websites, and several others know of two cemeteries along West Sheepneck Road in Sandy Hook, Tennessee: Orr Chapel Cemetery and Sheepneck Cemetery. The two cemeteries are side-by-side. Sheepneck Cemetery was used by the Rogers family and Orr Chapel Cemetery was used by Orr Chapel for the members of the church right beside the cemetery, both in  use since the late 1800s.

The church was demolished and  the cemeteries were dug up and pulverized to make way for a development after the CIA irradiated my family that lived in Sandy Hook killing them all within a day. 

Sandy Hook was an unincorporated city, and is nothing more than farmland owned by the Crawley and Rogers families. 

My cousin, Prince Rogers Nelson, wrote a song called "Alphabet Street" that says "we have to go down, down, down because that's the only way, to make this cruel, cruel world hear what we have to say." 

He also wrote a song about two of Sandy Hook’s permanent residents who were side by side for what we thought for all eternity, interred at Sheepneck Cemetery. My mother, Patricia Ann Crawley Rogers Williams, was emotionally distraught when a funeral director asked her where my grandmother, Lila Crawley Richardson, was to be buried. Mom indicated Sheepneck instinctively. The policies of Sheepneck Cemetery dictated my grandmother's plot--right next to my grandfather. It wasn't because of their marriage, as they never were, in Sheepneck Cemetery the  burial plot is always the next available spot. My grandmother should have never been buried there, she was a Crawley, a member of the other family in Sandy Hook. But my mother didn't even consider that when asked where to bury her as she visited her father's grave every time we were in Sandy Hook. 

For the child born of the woman spoken of in Prince’s "Raspberry Beret" and her descendants, there was only one family in Sandy Hook, Tennessee--ours. I'm not exactly sure when everyone else realized the mistake, but they never tried to correct it even through my step grandmother, the widow of my grandfather and the mother of most of his other children, lived across the street. My mother was the baby of the Rogers clan. I am calling the upcoming grave audit of my family's cemetery, "Lila's Revenge," because of my step-grandmother never demanded she be dug up, how on Earth could the CIA even fathom such. 

### The Great Millstone
There is a headstone on my alphabet street that had an inscription that read (something like) "God loves you a whole lot." The exact inscription is now only known to God and myself. However, because of the vernacular of Sandy Hook and my family it is truly bad English.

The monument company that milled the stone had employees who cared enough about quality to not send out such a permanent display of really bad English. So in a time before computers, the paper work order was reviewed, and several of those employees "signed off" on it after calling my country family repeatedly to confirm it. One even went letter-by-letter and was dumbfounded that a family in the USA could be so ignorant. The headstone arrived and my family admired its beauty and of the inscription simply said "Amen."

I have spoken to God, who is the Creator, He was not offended by their poor English, He appreciates all worship. He did tell me though that He would tell me the exact location of the archival box contraining the paperwork bearing the signatures of those employees who cared enough to do their jobs thoroughly.

> [!NOTE]
> At the end of "Alphabet Street" by Prince you'll hear the alphabet being recited with the letter "G" skipped, He responds after the letter "H".

On a personal note: I truly believe the Creator created the perfect sale of granite headstones by a large, far away, monument company that caused my family to "clip the coupon" and call them for the order.  Had it been a local company, they would have either spoken the vernacular or knew the family and would have never bothered with so many verifications of the order. Because of that single piece of paper, I have the proof that the headstones there now are fake.

So, when I find graves in the wrong places, I'll simply go "down, down, down" and have my family members "brought up." When they aren't, I'll have the attention of the world and I can finally get the word out about TAG.
