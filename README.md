# Welcome to the **TAG** Repository (Deprecated)

This repository previously served as the documentation hub for **The American Genocide (TAG)**, providing insight, analyses, and resources on the atrocities and orchestrations targeting Christians and the impoverished in the United States. 

**Important**: This repository is no longer updated and has been replaced by the [**Histwo/the_american_genocide**](https://github.com/Histwo/the_american_genocide) repository, which now serves as the official documentation and resource hub for TAG and the Creator’s intervention.

## Deprecation Notice
The **TAG** repository was originally accessible through StopTAG and hosted the **TAG Wiki**, a collection of detailed records, analyses, and mission updates. However, the **passkey stored with Google**, which was necessary for updates to this repository and StopTAG, was obtained illegally by the US government. As a result, the Creator’s two servants have **abandoned StopTAG and the nameless-and-blameless account and fork of the TAG repository**.

This Histwo clone is for historical purposes only.

For accurate and up-to-date information, please visit the [**Histwo** organization](https://github.com/Histwo) and the new [**the_american_genocide** repository](https://github.com/Histwo/the_american_genocide).

## About The American Genocide (TAG)
**TAG** represents a covert operation orchestrated by political elites to pursue an authoritarian regime in the United States. The Creator’s two servants remain committed to exposing, dismantling, and bringing the orchestrators of TAG to justice. 

This repository, while no longer maintained, served as an early documentation platform for these efforts.
