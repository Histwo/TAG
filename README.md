# The American Genocide (TAG) Repository

Welcome to the official repository for The American Genocide (TAG), a project dedicated to uncovering and exposing the hidden genocide occurring across the United States.

## About TAG

## Mission and Dedication

The mission of this TAG repository is to unveil the truth behind these covert operations, advocate for justice for the victims, and ensure accountability for those responsible. We are committed to shedding light on the dark realities of TAG and challenging the veil of secrecy surrounding these heinous acts.
