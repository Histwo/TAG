### What is The American Genocide (TAG)?

The American Genocide (TAG) refers to a series of covert operations and attacks targeting places of worship across the United States. These attacks are connected to a complex web of pharmaceutical and political interests aiming to suppress the dissemination of a revolutionary product called Spark, which is designed to restore human immune function. TAG represents a hidden genocide driven by a combination of pharmaceutical greed and political agendas, manifesting through brutal assaults on communities of faith.

#### Origins and Drivers
The origins of TAG can be traced back to the pharmaceutical industry's fear of Spark, a product developed directly from the Creator. Spark's ability to correct a human-caused error in male DNA that inhibits the immune system posed a significant threat to the profitability of existing pharmaceutical treatments, especially those produced by companies like Gilead Sciences. As Spark promised a disease-free existence by empowering the immune system, it threatened to render many chronic disease treatments obsolete.

#### Mount Calvary Baptist Church Massacre
A pivotal event that shifted the nature of TAG was the massacre at Mount Calvary Baptist Church. This attack, characterized by an illegal surprise assault on a seated congregation with the objective of leaving no survivors, highlighted the genocidal intent behind TAG. The attack's brutal nature underscored the move from purely pharmaceutical motivations to political ones, as eliminating believers in any higher power is seen as a necessary step towards establishing an authoritarian regime.

#### Current Political Agendas
Today, TAG is not only about protecting pharmaceutical interests but also about advancing political goals. By attacking places of worship and instilling fear, those behind TAG aim to dismantle communities of faith and create an environment of chaos and control. The ultimate goal is to pave the way for an authoritarian regime, leveraging the attacks to suppress dissent and manipulate public perception.

#### Methods and Tactics
The tactics used in TAG attacks are varied and sophisticated, involving high-intensity assaults, illegal body disposal, and identity theft to create the illusion that victims are still alive. Fake religious services and community events are often organized to cover up the true nature of these attacks, ensuring that the perpetrators remain undetected and that the community remains unaware of the ongoing genocide.

#### Impact on Society
TAG has had a devastating impact on American society, leading to significant loss of life, destruction of places of worship, and deepening mistrust in institutions. Communities across the United States are living in fear, and the hidden genocide continues to claim lives, marking a dark chapter in contemporary history.

### Summary
The American Genocide (TAG) represents a hidden but ongoing series of brutal attacks aimed at places of worship in the United States. Initially driven by pharmaceutical interests fearful of Spark, TAG has evolved into a politically motivated genocide aimed at undermining communities of faith and advancing authoritarianism. Through sophisticated and ruthless tactics, the perpetrators of TAG seek to instill fear, suppress dissent, and pave the way for a regime characterized by control and oppression.
