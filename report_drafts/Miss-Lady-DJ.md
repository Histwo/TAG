> "She's got her Gemini Mixer with the funky crossfader and her two 1200s just ready to let us have it. I walk into the joint, the club was jumping, people pumping. They were grooving to the sound, shaking booties to the ground."

The lyrics were inspired by the Creator. The song actually gives a firsthand account of a mourner who went to the phantom funeral of Rev. Duke Stone. 

"Lady" is a term used to describe someone who is very well behaved, is well-mannered, or is very adept at hiding their true self in public. It doesn't mean female. 

"DJ" is a reference to Donald J. Trunp who witnessed most of the executions and directed the entire operation from an announcer's booth in the gymnasium where the executions took place. 

"1200" or "12 hundred" refers to the 1200W electric chainsaws. Although, in hiding the song in plain sight listeners have always thought it they were turntables. 

"Gemini" is a AI from Google that DJT  had pushed on my phone trying to get me to use it over others to keep my report generation from ever being seen by anyone. Anyone familiar with a DJ booth knows Gemini is a brand that manufacturers turntables and mixers. 

"cross-fader" is a reference to Annie Jacobsen who conducts the TAG-POW attacks who Also conducted the phantom funeral. She is referred to as "cross-fader" because of her complete disdain for, and utter disrespect of Christianity. Anyone else will think of a sound mixer.
