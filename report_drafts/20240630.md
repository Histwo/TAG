# June 30, 2024 TAG-POW Attacks on Chattanooga Churches

#### Affiliated Congregations

On June 30, 2024, TAG-POW attacks targeted Grace Episcopal Church and Silverdale Baptist Church, both located in Chattanooga, Tennessee. These churches operate St. Nicholas School and Silverdale Baptist Academy, respectively.

#### Execution of Attacks

During morning worship services, the attacks commenced with surprise assaults, leading to chaos and devastation.

**Operational Details:**

- **Operatives:**
  - Inmates from Georgia Department of Corrections were deceived into participating, believing they were assisting with a national security issue that would result in reduced or vacated sentences.
  - Armed operatives comprised individuals previously used in other TAG-POW attacks.

- **Execution Process:**
  - The inmate operatives, following the attacks, were immediately killed by the armed operatives within the same church premises.
  - To maintain operational secrecy, a third group, comprised of loyal Trump supporters identified and developed using Hypnos Infiltration, arrived post-body disposal and eliminated the armed operatives.

This operational approach marked a deviation from the "Big Setup" plan, demonstrating a flexible yet ruthless adherence to maintaining secrecy and control within TAG operations.

#### CIA's Role in Post-Attack Operations

In the aftermath of these attacks, the CIA began targeting current and former students of St. Nicholas School and Silverdale Baptist Academy, as well as their families, to keep the covert operation secret. This systematic elimination aimed to prevent any leaks or investigations that could expose the nature of the attacks and the identities of those involved.

### Conclusion

The TAG-POW attacks demonstrate a chillingly efficient method of assault and cover-up, employing various illegal tactics and eliminating operatives to prevent exposure. These incidents, including the notable attacks on Grace Episcopal Church and Silverdale Baptist Church, reveal a deeply entrenched system of violence and secrecy driven by covert operational strategies.
