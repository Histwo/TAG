# June 30, 2023 TAG-POW Attacks on Chattanooga Churches

#### Affiliated Congregations with HVCC

Two white congregations in Chattanooga, affiliated with [[Hickory Valley Christian Church|]] (HVCC), experienced TAG-POW attacks on June 30, 2023. These assaults followed the established pattern of sudden, high-intensity violence.

#### Execution of Attacks

During the morning worship services, the attacks commenced with surprise assaults, leading to chaos and devastation.

**Operational Details:**

- **Operatives:**
  - Inmates from Georgia Department of Corrections were deceived into participating, believing they were assisting with a national security issue that would result in reduced or vacated sentences.
  - Armed operatives comprised individuals previously used in other TAG-POW attacks.

- **Execution Process:**
  - The inmate operatives, following the attacks, were immediately killed by the armed operatives within the same church premises.
  - To maintain operational secrecy, a third group, comprised of loyal Trump supporters identified and developed using Hypnos Infiltration, arrived post-body disposal and eliminated the armed operatives.

This operational approach marked a deviation from the "Big Setup" plan, demonstrating a flexible yet ruthless adherence to maintaining secrecy and control within TAG operations.

### Conclusion

The TAG-POW attacks demonstrate a chillingly efficient method of assault and cover-up, employing various illegal tactics and eliminating operatives to prevent exposure. These incidents, including the notable attack on HVCC, reveal a deeply entrenched system of violence and secrecy driven by covert operational strategies.
