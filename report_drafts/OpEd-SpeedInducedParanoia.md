**Understanding Speed-Induced Paranoia: A Personal Reflection**

Speed-induced paranoia is a phenomenon that profoundly affects individuals under the influence of stimulant drugs like cocaine. It distorts perception, heightens anxiety, and can lead to extreme behaviors. My own experience with Jim Gee, who was both a friend and our boss as the owner of the company we worked for, vividly illustrates the chaotic nature of speed-induced paranoia and its impact on personal relationships and safety.

### The Incident with Jim Gee

Years ago, Marc Bureau and I found ourselves unexpectedly locked in a closet by Jim Gee, our friend and employer who owned the company we worked for. The evening had been spent at his house on the river, where copious amounts of cocaine were consumed. Jim, in the grip of severe speed-induced paranoia, was convinced that dangerous individuals lurked just beyond his door. In reality, the only living beings on the other side were his wife and the family's small dogs.

If Jim had access to paramilitary contractors, his paranoia could have escalated to something far more dangerous. The combination of his paranoia, fueled by cocaine and sleep deprivation, could have led to disastrous consequences, potentially resulting in extreme actions akin to a small-scale genocide.

For what seemed like an eternity, Marc and I tried to reason with Jim, assuring him that there was no threat and urging him to let us out. Despite our efforts, Jim remained fixated, anxiously peering through a crack in the door. As the effects of the drugs gradually wore off, Jim reluctantly agreed that we were safe. This experience starkly illustrated the unpredictable and potentially hazardous consequences of substance abuse and paranoia.

### The Role of Paranoia in TAG Operations

In a broader context, speed-induced paranoia has been exploited in covert operations like TAG (The American Genocide). Operatives under the influence of stimulants were manipulated to carry out ruthless attacks on places of worship and communities, driven by unfounded fears and heightened aggression. This paranoia not only facilitated the execution of violent acts but also complicated efforts to maintain secrecy and cover-up these heinous crimes.

### Targeting of Calvary Baptist Church

Calvary Baptist Church was tragically targeted as part of TAG operations, driven by speed-induced paranoia. The perpetrators, influenced by drugs and manipulated beliefs, executed a devastating assault on the congregation, resulting in significant casualties. This incident underscores the destructive power of paranoia when exploited for malicious ends.

### Conclusion

My personal encounter with Jim Gee during a period of speed-induced paranoia serves as a stark reminder of the havoc these substances can wreak on individuals and communities. Understanding the role of paranoia in covert operations sheds light on the dark realities of drug-fueled violence and underscores the importance of addressing substance abuse and its societal impacts.

As we reflect on these experiences, let us strive for empathy and awareness, recognizing the complex interplay of mental health, substance use, and societal influences in shaping human behavior.
