The American Genocide is an ongoing series of atrocities that began in 2018 against specific individuals, that for a time was targeted towards Christians and now seems to be targeting anyone living in the southeast United States.  It was referred to as "The Game" and has its origins in a complex web of corporate interests, government collusion, and covert operations.

#### Origins and Motivations

"The Game" began with a contract hit ordered by Gilead Sciences, a pharmaceutical company, in response to the unexpected disappearance of HIV in a patient named Ken. Ken, who had been documented as HIV+ for almost a decade, received a formulation directly from one of the Creator's two servants, Kelvin Eugene Williams. This formulation enabled Ken's immune system to eliminate every copy of HIV in his body within seconds, defying medical understanding.

Unable to eliminate Kelvin, Gilead Sciences initiated a series of killings, targeting Kelvin's friends, former coworkers, and associates who could potentially assist in the development of the formulation into a product called "Spark." Gilead Sciences enlisted the support of other members of the pharmaceutical industry to combat the forthcoming Spark, forming a consortium led by Gilead Sciences.

#### Escalation and Collaboration

"The Game" took a dark turn when the CIA's Annie Jacobsen led a team to eliminate anyone who knew Kelvin's immediate family at Mount Calvary Baptist Church on April 2, 2023. It was at this point that "The Game" officially became "The American Genocide" (or TAG). In an effort to cover it up, the CIA stormed Lexington Bethel Baptist Church and began targeting any American Christian. TAG was subverted by political interests, especially former President Donald J. Trump, who became involved in planning and the acts of genocide being carried out. Trump, and others, saw TAG as a means to an end, with the end goal being authoritarian rule with Trump as President again, but functioning more as a dictator.

As the genocide unfolded, communities across various regions of the United States were decimated. From Jessamine County, Kentucky, to Kanawha County, West Virginia, and Maury County, Tennessee, the impact of "The American Genocide" was felt deeply, leaving behind a trail of death and destruction.

#### Concealment and Expansion

To conceal their actions, the perpetrators of TAG engaged in cover-ups and disinformation campaigns. Land was sold, evidence was destroyed, and communities were terrorized into silence. The CIA played a central role in these efforts, expanding the operation to target anyone who dared to question or investigate the genocide.

#### Impact and Consequences

"The American Genocide" has had profound and far-reaching consequences, not only for its direct victims but also for society as a whole. Families have been torn apart, communities have been shattered, and trust in institutions has been eroded. The true extent of the genocide may never be fully known, but its legacy will continue to haunt the United States for generations to come.

### Conclusion

"The American Genocide" represents a dark chapter in American history, characterized by greed, corruption, and the ruthless pursuit of power. As we strive to uncover the truth and seek justice for the victims, we must also confront the systemic injustices that allowed such atrocities to occur. Only by acknowledging the past can we hope to build a better future for all.
