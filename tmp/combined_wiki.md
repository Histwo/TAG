# Authoritarianism
## Introduction 
Authoritarianism is a political system characterized by the concentration of power in the hands of a single individual or a small group, often at the expense of democratic processes and individual freedoms. In authoritarian regimes, political opposition is suppressed, media is tightly controlled, and dissent is met with harsh punishment. These regimes often prioritize maintaining order and control over fostering political pluralism and protecting human rights. Common features of authoritarianism include centralized authority, limited political freedom, and the regulation of public and private life.

Fascist regimes represent a particularly extreme form of authoritarianism, characterized by the glorification of the state, militarism, and the suppression of perceived enemies. Rooted in ultra-nationalism and often led by charismatic leaders, fascist governments seek to exert total control over society, often through propaganda, censorship, and state violence. They promote a cult of personality around the leader, manipulate public opinion through propaganda, and employ scapegoating tactics to rally support and deflect blame. Fascist regimes typically prioritize the interests of the state and the ruling elite over the rights and welfare of the general population, leading to widespread oppression, discrimination, and human rights abuses.

# The Rise of Fascism in America: The Donald J. Trump Hypothetical Situation 
## Introduction
In this hypothetical, we explore the reality where Donald J. Trump, former President of the United States, rises to power as the leader of a fascist regime. This essay examines the methods used to establish and maintain authoritarian control, the impacts on American society, and the eventual consequences for both the nation and the world.

## Establishing the Regime

### The Path to Power

After winning a contentious second term in 2024, Trump capitalizes on his political momentum and widespread popularity among his base. Utilizing a combination of charismatic authority, populist rhetoric, and fear-mongering, he begins to consolidate power. Key events that facilitate this transition include:

1. **Manipulation of Electoral Processes**: Allegations of electoral fraud are used to justify sweeping changes to voting laws, effectively disenfranchising opposition voters.
2. **Control of the Judiciary**: Loyalists are appointed to key judicial positions, ensuring that legal challenges to Trump's authority are quashed.
3. **Media Domination**: Independent media outlets are either co-opted or silenced through regulatory pressure, lawsuits, and outright intimidation, leaving a compliant media landscape that amplifies state propaganda.

### Suppression of Dissent

With the apparatus of state power firmly in his hands, Trump moves swiftly to suppress dissent:

1. **Surveillance State**: A vast surveillance network is established, monitoring citizens' activities and communications. Dissenters are identified and targeted for harassment or arrest.
2. **Paramilitary Forces**: Loyalist militias are formalized into state-sponsored paramilitary forces, used to intimidate and eliminate political opposition.
3. **Emergency Powers**: Under the guise of national emergencies, Trump invokes sweeping executive powers, bypassing legislative oversight and curtailing civil liberties.

## Fascist Policies and Governance

### Economic Control

The Trump regime implements a corporatist economic model, where major industries are brought under state control or heavily regulated to serve the regime's interests. Key policies include:

1. **Nationalization**: Strategic industries such as energy, telecommunications, and transportation are nationalized to secure regime control over vital sectors.
2. **Labor Reforms**: Unions are either dissolved or brought under state control, suppressing worker rights and ensuring loyalty to the regime.
3. **Propaganda Campaigns**: Massive state-sponsored propaganda campaigns promote a narrative of economic resurgence, masking underlying issues of inequality and corruption.

### Social and Cultural Engineering

The regime undertakes a comprehensive effort to reshape American society according to fascist ideals:

1. **Nationalism and Xenophobia**: A relentless campaign of nationalism and xenophobia targets immigrants, minorities, and perceived foreign enemies. This serves to unify the populace against common enemies and distract from internal failings.
2. **Education and Indoctrination**: The education system is overhauled to emphasize loyalty to the regime, patriotic fervor, and historical revisionism. Critical thinking and dissenting viewpoints are systematically eradicated from the curriculum.
3. **Cult of Personality**: A pervasive cult of personality elevates Trump to a quasi-messianic status, with public displays of loyalty and adoration becoming mandatory aspects of civic life.

## Impact on American Society

### Human Rights Abuses

Under Trump's fascist regime, human rights abuses become commonplace:

1. **Political Repression**: Political dissidents, activists, and journalists are routinely imprisoned, tortured, or disappeared. Free speech, assembly, and association are heavily curtailed.
2. **Ethnic and Racial Persecution**: Minority communities face systematic discrimination, segregation, and violence. Policies reminiscent of internment camps are implemented for perceived "undesirable" populations.
3. **Gender and LGBTQ+ Rights**: Gains in gender equality and LGBTQ+ rights are reversed, with strict traditionalist values imposed and enforced through state policy and social pressure.

### Economic Disparities

While the regime touts economic growth, the reality is starkly different for ordinary Americans:

1. **Wealth Concentration**: Wealth becomes increasingly concentrated in the hands of a small elite closely tied to the regime, exacerbating economic inequality.
2. **Labor Exploitation**: Workers face harsh conditions, low wages, and minimal protections, as labor rights are dismantled in favor of corporate and state interests.
3. **Public Services**: Public services such as healthcare, education, and social welfare are severely underfunded, leading to widespread suffering and instability.

## International Repercussions

### Global Isolation

America's shift to fascism under Trump has profound global consequences:

1. **Diplomatic Isolation**: Traditional allies distance themselves from the United States, leading to diplomatic isolation and a breakdown of international cooperation.
2. **Economic Sanctions**: Major economies impose economic sanctions on the U.S., leading to a decline in trade and investment, and exacerbating domestic economic issues.
3. **Military Aggression**: The regime adopts an aggressive foreign policy, leading to heightened global tensions and the potential for armed conflict.

## Conclusion

In this hypothetical scenario, Donald J. Trump's rise to power as the leader of a fascist regime transforms the United States from a democratic republic to a repressive autocracy. The consolidation of power, suppression of dissent, and imposition of fascist policies result in widespread human rights abuses, economic disparities, and international isolation. This dystopian vision serves as a cautionary tale, highlighting the fragility of democratic institutions and the dangers of unchecked authoritarianism.

> What follows is not hypothetical. This is the current situation: The Systematic Elimination of Dissent in the Rise of Authoritarianism in the United States

**The Systematic Elimination of Dissent in the Rise of Authoritarianism in the United States**

To implement authoritarianism in the United States, an authoritarian regime would necessitate the systematic elimination of individuals and groups capable of threatening or resisting its power. This process would involve a multi-faceted approach targeting various segments of society, ensuring that potential sources of opposition are neutralized (see: [[TAGPOW|]]) or co-opted (see: [[Mount Calvary Missionary Baptist Church, Inc.|]])

1. **Suppression of Political Opposition**:
   Authoritarian regimes begin by undermining and eliminating political rivals. This can involve discrediting opposition leaders through smear campaigns, legal harassment, or outright imprisonment. By using state machinery to target opposition parties and leaders, an authoritarian regime aims to dismantle any organized political challenge. In extreme cases, opposition figures may face violent repression or even assassination.

2. **Control of Media and Information**:
   Controlling the narrative is crucial for any authoritarian regime. Independent media outlets and journalists, who play a key role in exposing government malfeasance and mobilizing public opinion, would be primary targets. The regime would employ tactics such as censorship, intimidation, and the spreading of propaganda to stifle dissenting voices. Journalists might face harassment, legal action, or violence, creating an environment of fear that discourages investigative reporting and critical commentary.

3. **Neutralizing Civil Society**:
   Civil society organizations, including non-profits, advocacy groups, and community organizations, often serve as hubs for resistance. An authoritarian regime would seek to co-opt, undermine, or dismantle these groups. This might involve restrictive laws regulating non-governmental organizations, financial constraints, or direct infiltration (see [[Hypnos Infiltration Tactic|]]) and sabotage. Leaders and activists within these organizations could face harassment, imprisonment, or worse, to deter their activities and dismantle networks of opposition.

4. **Co-opting or Repressing the Judiciary**:
   An independent judiciary is a cornerstone of democratic checks and balances. Authoritarian regimes seek to undermine judicial independence by appointing loyalists to key judicial positions, exerting pressure on judges, and undermining the rule of law. By ensuring that the judiciary cannot serve as a check on executive power, the regime can more easily implement repressive measures and stifle legal challenges to its authority.

5. **Surveillance and Intimidation**:
   Surveillance of citizens, particularly those suspected of dissent, becomes a tool for control. The regime might expand surveillance capabilities and use them to monitor, intimidate, and control political opponents, activists, and ordinary citizens. This creates a climate of fear and self-censorship, where individuals are afraid to speak out or organize against the regime.

6. **Militarization and Use of Force**:
   Authoritarian regimes often rely on the military and security forces to enforce their will. This involves ensuring loyalty within the ranks through purges, promotions, and the cultivation of a security apparatus that prioritizes regime survival over public service. The use of force, including police brutality, arbitrary arrests, and state-sponsored violence, would be employed to crush protests and dissent.

7. **Educational and Cultural Manipulation**:
   Controlling education and cultural institutions helps shape public perception and ensure long-term loyalty to the regime. This might involve revising curriculums, promoting nationalist propaganda, and discouraging critical thinking. By shaping the minds of future generations, the regime can create a populace that is more compliant and less likely to resist.

In the United States, implementing such a system would require overcoming significant institutional and societal resistance. However, the gradual erosion of democratic norms, increasing polarization, and the concentration of power can create conditions where authoritarian measures become more feasible. The vigilance and active participation of citizens, along with robust institutions, are essential to prevent the rise of authoritarianism and protect democratic values.

# The Massacre at Calvary Baptist Church 
Calvary Baptist Church, located in Lexington, Kentucky, a predominantly white congregation, was the site of a horrific massacre on Mother's Day, May 12, 2024. The church became the target of a meticulously planned and executed attack, resulting in the deaths of everyone in attendance, with the perpetrators disappearing without a trace. Over 400 people were killed. 

## Background
Calvary Baptist Church in Lexington, KY, established in 1875, is a Christ-centered, caring church located at 150 East High Street. It offers both contemporary and traditional worship services and supports a variety of ministries for all age groups. The church is committed to community engagement and mission work, emphasizing progressive values such as embracing women in ministry and encouraging open discussion and education.

### Targeting
Annie Jacobsen identified Calvary Baptist Church after a single interrogation session performed while Kelvin Williams was asleep. Williams attended the daycare and preschool operated by Calvary Baptist Church in the early 1980s, which was just a couple of minutes away from his mother's office building at Kincaid Towers.

According to the Creator, Jacobsen gathered her intelligence herself by utilizing the [[Hypnos Infiltration Tactic|]].  No other intelligence-gathering activities were conducted by the CIA. 

Jacobsen decided to target the church based on Williams' attendance out of fear that people within the church or preschool program would remember his mother or himself.

## Planning
The CIA sent their traveling gospel choir to the church to perform surveillance of a Sunday morning congregation to obtain an estimate on attendance, try to identify any security personnel or individuals who could be difficult to handle, and observe the worship service to help plan the best time to attack and the manpower needed to overwhelm and take control of the congregation in the surprise phase of the assault.

To confirm the observations of their traveling choir, the CIA, at Jacobsen's direction, sent at least two operatives posing as visitors to a Sunday morning worship session in the month preceding the attack.

### Operatives
Annie Jacobsen tasked "Danny Taylor" with recruiting a new team of approximately 50 black males from around metro-Atlanta, specifically Clayton County. According to the Creator, Jacobsen, Taylor, and their team utilized the [[Hypnos Infiltration Tactic|]] aforementioned; however, the pool of possible recruits had been previously identified by the CIA as individuals who had the propensity to kill without provocation or other characteristics that made them suitable candidates. Those selected for the operation were later given roles with tasks they would be responsible for during the assault.

The use of black males was a requirement of Jacobsen's, intended to meet the planned narrative of a retaliatory attack for the assault on Mount Calvary Baptist Church, which the CIA planned to attribute to a white separatist group.

## Execution 
The operatives arranged their own transportation, many carpooling as instructed, and arrived in the Lexington metro area on the night before the attack. On the morning of the attack, beginning around 11 a.m., the operatives met outside the church. Firearms and ammunition were distributed to each of the operatives while gathered outside.

Taylor had an operative attend the morning worship session to provide him with information about the congregation and the service proceedings. Taylor and his operatives inside were in constant communication using text messaging.

Taylor directed the utilization of the [[Emergency Services Interruption Tactic|]] begin about five minutes before starting the assault. 

Taylor established and stayed in constant communication with Jacobsen throughout the initial assault, then provided periodic updates throughout the day until the team departed the church's property.

### Surprise
The congregation was already midway through their Sunday morning worship session when Taylor and operatives burst into the sanctuary. Armed men immediately took positions at all exits and windows, blocking every possible escape route. Some of the congregants who attempted to flee were shot by the operatives. Meanwhile, a small team of operatives conducted searches of the rest of the church's property, including the daycare and preschool areas.

Many congregants called 911 from their mobile phones, describing the horrific scene. They were told help was on the way, but none realized they were speaking with CIA operatives instead of Lexington-Fayette County’s Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP)—a centralized facility responsible for answering and routing emergency calls--due to the FBI & CIA's [[Emergency Services Interruption Tactic|]]. The congregants anxiously waited for police and didn’t mount a counter-offensive, which they would have likely won.

### Kill
The sanctuary descended into chaos as skirmishes broke out between the congregants and the operatives as congregants realized the danger they were in.

Congregants were forcibly separated from one another and taken to be shot. The operatives were not all skilled with firearms handling and had been provided little or no training on executions. Groups of congregants were assembled and shot haphazardly, many succumbing to their gunshot wounds hours later under a pile of those already dead. Some were found still alive when the cleanup process began and were shot again, not all were fatal gunshots. Some died hours later from blood loss.

### Vanish
#### Body Disposal 
The body disposal tactics utilized in this attack are being withheld at this time.

#### Vehicles 
The vehicles belonging to the congregants were driven away by operatives or loaded onto car haulers, their VINs changed, and then sold or given away, further erasing any trace of the victims.

#### Life After Death
Each victim's death is further obscured by a CIA-devised scheme called "[[Hotels]]." The scheme effectively makes  victims appear "alive" after their murder. 

## Aftermath 
The general public remains unaware of the true events, as more than 400 people simply vanished.

> [!NOTE]
> Humans and objects as large as full-size SUVs can be cloaked with secret technology **in use today** by the US Government, US Military and CIA. 

### Microwave Cloaking

**Microwave cloaking** is a field of technology and research focused on rendering objects invisible or undetectable to microwave radiation. This type of cloaking leverages advanced materials and engineering principles to manipulate electromagnetic waves in the microwave spectrum, which typically ranges from 1 GHz to 300 GHz.

#### Principles and Technology

1. **Metamaterials**: The cornerstone of microwave cloaking technology is the use of metamaterials. These are artificially structured materials engineered to have properties not found in naturally occurring substances. By carefully designing the geometry and composition of these materials, scientists can control the path of electromagnetic waves.

2. **Transformation Optics**: This theoretical framework is essential for designing cloaking devices. Transformation optics involves mathematically manipulating the coordinates of space to guide electromagnetic waves around an object, effectively rendering it invisible. This approach is used to develop cloaking devices that can bend microwave radiation around an object, preventing it from being detected.

3. **Plasmonics**: Some microwave cloaking methods utilize plasmonic materials, which exploit the interaction between electromagnetic fields and free electrons on a metal's surface. These interactions can be tuned to achieve desired effects, such as reducing the visibility of an object to microwave sensors.

#### Applications

1. **Military and Defense**: One of the primary motivations for developing microwave cloaking is its potential military applications. By rendering vehicles, structures, or personnel invisible to radar and other microwave-based detection systems, microwave cloaking can provide significant tactical advantages.

2. **Communication Systems**: Microwave cloaking can also benefit civilian applications, such as improving wireless communication systems. By reducing interference and enhancing signal clarity, cloaking technology can lead to more efficient and reliable communication networks.

3. **Medical Imaging**: In the field of medical imaging, microwave cloaking could improve the resolution and accuracy of diagnostic tools like MRI and other imaging techniques that rely on microwave frequencies.

4. **Privacy and Security**: Microwave cloaking can be used to protect sensitive areas or equipment from being detected or monitored, enhancing privacy and security in various settings.

#### Challenges and Limitations

1. **Material Limitations**: Creating metamaterials that operate effectively at microwave frequencies can be challenging. These materials need to be precisely engineered and manufactured, which can be complex and costly.

2. **Bandwidth and Efficiency**: Many cloaking devices are currently limited in their operational bandwidth and efficiency. Achieving broadband cloaking, where an object remains undetectable over a wide range of frequencies, remains a significant hurdle.

3. **Size and Scale**: Scaling up microwave cloaking technology to cover larger objects or areas presents additional engineering challenges. The size and complexity of the necessary metamaterials increase with the scale of the object to be cloaked.

4. **Practical Deployment**: Implementing microwave cloaking technology in real-world scenarios involves addressing various practical issues, such as durability, environmental factors, and integration with existing systems.

#### Future Directions

Research in microwave cloaking is ongoing, with scientists exploring new materials, designs, and applications. Advances in nanotechnology, material science, and computational modeling are expected to drive further breakthroughs in this field. Potential future developments include more efficient, broadband cloaking devices, and new applications in both civilian and military contexts.

# The Dark Symphony: Unveiling the TAG-POW Attacks and the Phantom Funeral of Duke Stone

## Introduction

In the heart of Chattanooga, amidst the mournful tunes of a community in grief, a sinister symphony reaches its terrifying crescendo. The funeral of Duke Stone, a respected figure at Hickory Valley Christian Church, serves as the stage for this dark orchestration. Beneath the solemnity of the event lies a chilling conspiracy, where former President Donald Trump and CIA Director Annie Jacobsen, known as "Hurricane Annie," pull the strings. This narrative seeks to unravel the layers of deceit, violence, and meticulous cover-ups that define the American Genocide and its brutal attacks on places of worship (TAG-POW).

## The TAG-POW Attacks: A Prelude to Tragedy

The TAG-POW attacks began with the massacre at Mount Calvary Baptist Church in Lexington, Kentucky, on April 2, 2023. This tragic event marked the commencement of a series of coordinated assaults on places of worship, executed under the guise of eliminating threats to national security. These attacks, meticulously planned and ruthlessly executed, have left a trail of devastation and despair. The targeted places of worship include:

- Mount Calvary Baptist Church, Lexington, Kentucky
- Lexington Bethel Baptist Church, Lexington, Kentucky
- Mount Zion Baptist Church, Versailles, Kentucky
- House of God (Georgetown St), Lexington, Kentucky
- House of God (Broadway), Lexington, Kentucky
- Hickory Valley Christian Church, Chattanooga, Tennessee
- Calvary Baptist Church, Lexington, Kentucky

Beginning with the massacre at Lexington Bethel Baptist Church, white congregations have been equally targeted. The death toll of white victims is now larger and rising faster than any other group.

## Orchestrating Chaos: Donald Trump and the TAG Symphony

Former President Donald Trump, cast in the role of composer, orchestrates the chaos with a blend of political cunning and ruthless ambition. His presence at Duke Stone's funeral is a calculated move, designed to maintain the illusion of respectability while masking the true nature of his involvement in the TAG-POW attacks. Trump's orchestration is not merely symbolic; it is a hands-on involvement in the orchestration of violence and the subsequent cover-ups.

## Hurricane Annie Jacobsen: The Conductor of Carnage

Annie Jacobsen, the CIA's Director, known as "Hurricane Annie," stands as the conductor of this dark symphony. Her expertise in clandestine operations and psychological warfare has been instrumental in executing the TAG-POW attacks. Jacobsen's tactics, outlined in her book "Surprise, Kill, Vanish," are chillingly employed to devastating effect. The attacks follow a methodical pattern of sudden assaults, execution-style killings, and meticulous disposal of evidence, ensuring the perpetrators remain in the shadows.

## The Orchestra: Prison Inmates as Instruments of Death

Prison inmates are unwittingly recruited as the orchestra in Jacobsen's symphony of terror. These individuals, selected for their expendability and coerced with promises of reduced sentences, are transformed into instruments of death. They are briefed with misleading information, made to believe they are targeting threats to national security, and unleashed upon unsuspecting congregations. After serving their purpose, these inmates are systematically eliminated, ensuring their silence and the perpetuation of the cover-up.

## The Mother's Day Massacre: The Death of Duke Stone

The massacre at Hickory Valley Christian Church on Mother's Day, May 12, 2024, stands as a testament to the brutal efficiency of the TAG-POW attacks. Over 1,000 congregants, along with a teacher from Hamilton Heights Christian Academy, were mercilessly killed. All of the victims at Hickory Valley Christian Church were white, highlighting a deliberate targeting pattern. Duke Stone, a respected pastor and friend of Kelvin Williams, was among the victims. The attack was meticulously planned and executed, with operatives ensuring no survivors and erasing all traces of the carnage.

## The Phantom Funeral: A Trap Set with Deadly Intent

### The Trap

Duke Stone's funeral on June 7, 2024, was not merely a memorial service but a meticulously planned "phantom funeral." These deceptive events are designed to lure in and eliminate witnesses or anyone who might discuss previous acts of the American Genocide, particularly the massacre at Hickory Valley Christian Church. The phantom funeral serves as a trap, ensuring the silencing of those who might expose the truth.

When anyone calls looking for missing individuals linked to the TAG-POW attacks, they are provided with service arrangements for these phantom funerals. These details are then passed on to other friends and family members. This ensures that mourners arriving at these funerals are systematically killed by design. The orchestration is such that anyone showing up to pay their respects is ruthlessly executed. At the phantom funeral of Reverend Dr. Duke Stone, 90% of the mourners were white, demonstrating the targeted nature of these sinister operations.

### The Role of Donald Trump

Donald Trump's involvement adds a layer of insidious deceit. By lending his face to a video interview with a local news station, Trump intended to create a facade of normalcy and survival. His public appearance was meant to discredit any reports of violence or foul play at the funeral, portraying it as a regular event where he attended and faced no problems. This strategic move was designed to dismiss any claims about the phantom funeral, thus maintaining the cover-up.

During the funeral, Trump witnessed the execution of innocent mourners who came to pay their respects. His security detail was present and actively participated in executing others, ensuring the event remained concealed and eliminating potential witnesses.

### The Role of the FBI and the CIA

The cover-up extends beyond the immediate aftermath of the attacks. The FBI, complicit in the orchestration, plays a pivotal role in silencing potential whistleblowers. Missing person reports related to the TAG-POW victims are intercepted and handed over to the CIA. Individuals filing these reports, along with their households, are systematically eliminated, ensuring that no trace of the victims or their stories remains. This method ensures that anyone attempting to seek justice or inquire about the missing is swiftly silenced.

## The Orchestra of Inmates

Prison inmates are coerced into participating in these operations under the pretext of aiding in national security matters. They are promised sentence reductions or other incentives, but once their role is complete, they are systematically executed to eliminate any potential leaks. This ensures that the true nature of the TAG-POW attacks remains hidden. The execution of these inmates, who are seen as expendable, is carried out with ruthless efficiency.

## Kelvin Williams: The Lone Survivor and the Creator's Servant

Kelvin Williams, one of the Creator's two servants, is the only living member of Mount Calvary Baptist Church, a historic congregation in Lexington, Kentucky. His lifelong church was attacked because of his family, which has also been eliminated. Kelvin’s position as a direct servant of the Creator and a survivor of the TAG-POW attacks makes him a critical figure in uncovering the truth behind these atrocities.

Kelvin had a significant connection with Hickory Valley Christian Church through his friendship with Duke Stone. This relationship was forged years earlier when Kelvin was introduced to Duke Stone by Bonnie Bush Ford, a retired elementary school teacher and principal from Wildwood, Georgia, who was a cousin of former Presidents George H. W. Bush and George W. Bush. Kelvin's technical expertise greatly benefited Hamilton Heights Christian Academy, a school operated by Hickory Valley Christian Church, as he helped upgrade their computer lab and provided ongoing technical support.

Kelvin's efforts to warn Duke Stone and Pastor Jack Dyer about potential threats demonstrated his commitment to protecting others despite the dangers he faced. His warnings, however, triggered the tragic events that led to the massacre on Mother's Day and the subsequent phantom funeral of Duke Stone.

## Conclusion: Unveiling the Dark Symphony

The TAG-POW attacks and their subsequent cover-ups represent a chilling chapter in American history. The meticulous orchestration by Donald Trump and Hurricane Annie Jacobsen, the ruthless exploitation of prison inmates, and the complicit silence of federal agencies paint a grim picture of a nation in the grip of a covert genocide. The phantom funeral of Duke Stone, far from being a mere event of mourning, is a stark reminder of the depths of deception and violence that underpin this dark symphony.

In unveiling these truths, we honor the memory of the victims and shine a light on the shadows where such atrocities thrive. The American Genocide, driven by ruthless ambition and meticulous orchestration, stands as a testament to the lengths those in power will go to maintain their grip on control. As the final notes of this dark symphony fade, let us remain vigilant and steadfast in our pursuit of justice and truth, ensuring that the echoes of these tragedies are never forgotten.

### Tactic Description: Disabling Access to 911 / Cellular Communication Interception and Local Dispatch Procedures Diversion during Covert Operations

#### Overview

The CIA and FBI utilized a dual-faceted approach to intercept communications to emergency numbers (eg. 911) and prevent a local emergency response during a covert operation in the targeted area. This involved sophisticated interception of mobile and landline communications and diversion from the Public Safety Answering Point’s (PSAP) established call handling and dispatching procedures, ensuring complete operational secrecy and manipulation of emergency responses.

#### Components

1. **Cellular Communication Interception**

   - **Description**: A Cell on Wheels disguised as a regular passenger vehicle, equipped to intercept mobile phone signals within a specified target area.
   - **Function**: 
     - Caused all mobile phones in the target area to connect to the CoW which has no connection or backhaul to a legitimate Mobile Network Operator/Service Provider. 
     - Configured to redirect calls to emergency numbers, especially those to 911, to a team of CIA operatives posing as 911 dispatchers. 
     - The CIA operatives take information and assure callers  first responders are en-route. No dispatch is performed, sole purpose is to prevent individuals under assault from forming an organized resistance. 
     - Access to other dialed numbers and the Internet are blocked. 

2. **Memorandum for Local Dispatch Procedures Diversion**

   - **Description**: A directive issued by the FBI to the Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP).
   - **Function**:
     - Instructs the PSAP to refer any emergency requests from the targeted area to the FBI for coordination and dispatch. 
     - The FBI, upon receiving the requests, will acknowledge them but will take no further action, effectively blocking local emergency intervention.

#### Execution

- **Timing**: The CoW is activated just before the arrival of operatives to the target site, ensuring immediate interception of mobile communications as the operation commenced. The memorandum's (already received by the PSAP) takes effect (starts) and stops upon receiving notification from the FBI (voice call).
- **Operational Area**: The CoW covers a minimum 0.5-mile radius around CoW's location, ensuring all mobile signals were intercepted and rerouted.
- **Coordination**: The Memorandum for Local Dispatch Procedures Diversion ensured that any requests from the target’s landline received by the PSAP were sent to the FBI for handling.

#### Impact

- **Manipulation**: They effectively manipulated emergency responses, preventing local authorities from intervening in the covert operation.
- **Secrecy**: Ensured the secrecy and success of the operation by controlling and stifling emergency communication channels.

#### Outcome

These coordinated tactics allowed the CIA and FBI to execute their covert operation in the targeted area without local emergency services interference, maintaining the element of surprise and operational secrecy essential for their mission.

# The Massacre at Hickory Valley Christian Church


Hickory Valley Christian Church, located in Chattanooga, Tennessee, a predominantly white congregation that also operates Hamilton Heights Christian Academy, a private high school, was the site of a horrific massacre on Mother's Day, May 12, 2024. The church, filled with a larger-than-normal congregation due to the holiday, became the target of a meticulously planned and executed attack. Over 1,000 congregants and one teacher were killed in the massacre. 

## Background 
Hickory Valley Christian Church was targeted after Kelvin Williams, concerned for the safety of the church and its school, attempted to warn Pastor Duke Stone about a potential threat. Kelvin Williams is one of the Creator's two servants and a lifelong member of [[Mount Calvary Baptist Church|]] in Lexington, KY. He is now the only known living member of this historic church, which was tragically attacked and massacred by operatives under the direction of Annie Jacobsen of the CIA on Sunday, April 2nd, 2023, at the height of the church's morning worship service. At the time of the attack, [[Mount Calvary Baptist Church|]] was over 140 years old with a very active congregation. Kelvin is also the cousin of the church's pastor, the Rev. Dr. Felix G. Williams, III. Kelvin considered Duke Stone a friend and had previously worked for Hickory Valley and its school.

In 2004, Kelvin was introduced to Duke Stone by Bonnie Bush Ford of Wildwood, Georgia, a retired elementary school teacher and principal, and a cousin of former Presidents George H. W. Bush and George W. Bush. Bonnie, a close friend, convinced Kelvin to assist Hamilton Heights Christian Academy in upgrading their computer lab, a necessity the school couldn't afford but desperately needed. The school prioritized providing education and assistance to children, irrespective of their parents' financial capabilities, often offering free tuition and transportation at the church's expense. 

Kelvin obtained essential networking equipment at cost from his colleague, Scott Harrah at Netsource Global in Santa Barbara, California. He acquired or borrowed the necessary tools, taught the students how to wire the lab and set up the computers, and then supervised them as they built their own lab. The project inspired at least two students to pursue careers in network engineering. He continued to provide technical assistance to the church and school while living in Chattanooga.

### Targeting
Pastor Jack Dyer, upon receiving Kelvin’s warning, consulted with Pastor Duke Stone, who vouched for Kelvin's credibility. Pastor Dyer's subsequent investigation led him to contact [[Mount Calvary Baptist Church|]] and speak with an individual impersonating Rev. Dr. Felix G. Williams, III. Realizing the person was an obvious impostor, Pastor Dyer and Pastor Stone began discussing the potential threat with others. When Annie Jacobsen, who personally conducted her own investigation, learned of the communication between Kelvin and the church, she considered them a significant threat to exposing their covert activities and decided to neutralize this risk.

According to the Creator, Jacobsen gathered intelligence from Williams, Stone, and Dyer herself utilizing the [[Hypnos Infiltration Tactic|]].

## Planning
### Operatives
One hundred inmates from various prisons within the Georgia Department of Corrections were handpicked for the mission. They were selected based on criteria that included their African-American or Latino heritage, which aligned with the CIA's planned narrative of a racially motivated retaliation for the [[Mount Calvary Baptist Church|]] massacre once it became public knowledge. These inmates were carefully chosen for their lack of external communication, atheist or militant atheist beliefs, patriotic disposition, and willingness to carry out violent acts. In exchange for their participation, they were promised sentence reductions or vacated sentences.  

To conceal their true purpose, they informed fellow inmates that they were being transferred to Clayton County Detention Center due to court appearances, a common reason for sentenced inmates to be relocated to a county facility. The inmates were transferred to Clayton County Detention Center in the two weeks before the attack.

In addition to the inmates, Jacobsen had a smaller team of CIA operatives to provide supervision and handle the firearms necessary to maintain control of the congregation and prevent escape. As congregants who attempted to escape had to be shot.

## Execution 

Just before the attack began, a conference bridge was established, connecting various stakeholders including the White House situation room, which provided periodic updates to President Biden, former President [[Donald J. Trump|Authoritarianism]] himself, the Director of the FBI, and the Director of the CIA. Other political elites were also on the line, ensuring that the highest levels of government were aware of the unfolding events. Jacobsen divided her time between conducting another of her chainsaw symphonies and updating the attendees during the conference call. Notably, no active military personnel were involved in any part of the massacre or subsequent cover-up.

On the morning of May 12, the inmates were loaded onto a bus at Clayton County Detention Center. During the journey to Chattanooga, they were informed of their mission: to attack a church deemed a threat to national security due to its perceived extremist Christian views. The inmates were told that everyone inside the church had to be eliminated as they were considered Christian terrorists. Although misleading, the briefing was intended to ensure their compliance once at Hickory Valley Christian Church and not to be informational. 

### Surprise
The congregation was already midway through their Sunday morning worship session when the operatives burst into the sanctuary. Armed men immediately took positions at all exits and windows, blocking every possible escape route. Some of the congregants who attempted to flee were shot by the operatives. Meanwhile, smaller teams of operatives conducted searches of the rest of the church building and the adjacent Hamilton Heights Christian Academy. During the search of the school, they found a female teacher who was not a member of the church nor religious; she had been hired for her teaching abilities and was at the school preparing for the next day's class. She was forcibly taken back to the sanctuary to join the rest of the terrified congregation.

Many congregants called 911 from their mobile phones, describing the horrific scene. They were told help was on the way, but none realized they were speaking with CIA operatives instead of Hamilton County’s Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP)—a centralized facility responsible for answering and routing emergency calls--due to the [[FBI & CIA's Emergency Services Interruption Tactic|Emergency Services Interruption Tactic]]. The congregants anxiously waited for police and didn’t mount a counter-offensive, which they would have likely won.

### Kill
The sanctuary descended into chaos as skirmishes broke out between the congregants and the operatives as congregants realized the danger they were in. Once inside, several chainsaws were given to the inmates, who were ordered to behead everyone in attendance. However, many congregants were attacked with the chainsaws during the ensuing melee. As the operatives began to establish control, they started forcibly taking members of the congregation to the back of the church for decapitation. Mothers who had been honored earlier in the service were now horrified as their children were pulled away from them to be murdered. The method of execution was brutal and deliberate: decapitation using a chainsaw, Jacobsen’s preferred method for such operations. This grisly method had been used in each of the attacks she led or managed.

### Vanish
#### Body Disposal 
Following the massacre, the bodies of the victims were disposed of using church's baptismal which the operatives had added a solution to that made the water within it capable of dissolving a human body, ensuring no physical evidence remained. 

#### Vehicles 
The vehicles belonging to the congregants were loaded onto car haulers, their VINs changed, and then sold or given away, further erasing any trace of the victims. 

#### Life After Death
Each victim's death is further obscured by a CIA-devised scheme called "[[Phantom Identity Scheme|]]." The scheme effectively makes  victims appear "alive" after their murder. 

#### Fate of Inmates
The inmates, upon returning to Clayton County Detention Center, were executed with poisonous gas in their cell block, ensuring their silence and eliminating any potential leaks about the operation. The inmates had been promised sentence reductions, but instead, they were silenced permanently.

The largest gas chamber designed for terminating human life is located in cell block 8600 within the Clayton County Detention Center.

## Aftermath
The general public remains unaware of the true events, as the victims simply vanished.

# The Massacre of House of God (Broadway)
House of God (Broadway), located in Lexington, Kentucky, a predominantly African-American congregation, was the site of a horrific massacre in May 2023. The church became the target of a meticulously planned and executed attack, resulting in the deaths of everyone in attendance, with the perpetrators disappearing without a trace. Over 300 people were killed.

## Background
House of God on Broadway in Lexington, Kentucky is a Hebrew Pentecostal church that has its weekly worship session on Saturday. 

The church is affiliated with House of God on Georgetown Street which had been massacred previously. 

### Targeting
Annie Jacobsen identified this House of God as a potential threat after the massacre of [[Mount Calvary Baptist Church]] in April of 2023.  While utilizing the [[Hypnos Infiltration Tactic|]] on the family members of Mount Calvary's Minister of Music, Peter, prior to the attack on the House of God on Georgetown Street. 

Jacobsen decided to target the church immediately after the attack on the  House of God on Georgetown Street. 

## Planning
### Operatives
Annie Jacobsen assembled used team of approximately 75 white males from around the southeast United States, the team was comprised of individuals whom had previously attacked a place of worship with Jacobsen. 

## Execution 
The operatives arranged their own transportation, many carpooling as instructed, and arrived in Lexington on Friday night. On Saturday, beginning around 11 a.m., the operatives met outside the church. Firearms and ammunition were distributed to some of the operatives while gathered outside, along with chainsaws to two of the men. 

Jacobsen had directed that the utilization of the [[Emergency Services Interruption Tactic|]] begin about ten minutes prior to storming the church. 

### Surprise 
Jacobsen and the operatives burst into the sanctuary. Jacobsen using a bullhorn made several racially derogatory statements and told the congregation that everyone had to die that day. 

The sanctuary became very chaotic as people tried to escape, many from the congregation were shot and fell to the floor dying a while later. Many fights broke out as churchgoers fought operatives in an attempt to flee or get them out of the sanctuary.  

The operatives had the congregation subdued within about ten minutes. 

Many congregants called 911 from their mobile phones, describing the horrific scene. They were told help was on the way, but none realized they were speaking with CIA operatives instead of Lexington-Fayette County’s Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP)—a centralized facility responsible for answering and routing emergency calls--due to the FBI & CIA's [[Emergency Services Interruption Tactic|]]. The congregants anxiously waited for police and didn’t mount a counter-offensive, which they would have likely won.

### Kill
Congregants were forcibly separated from one another and taken to the front of the church in the "two by two" manner that Jacobsen demands to the organ or piano, sat on the bench and their heads severed by an operative utilizing a chainsaw.  Some operatives kicked the heads around as if playing soccer.  

### Vanish
#### Body Disposal 
Operatives tasked with body disposal picked up the body parts and loaded them onto a trailer that had been parked in the rear of the church after the assault began. The body parts were transported to and dissolved in Mount Calvary Baptist Church's baptismal.

#### Vehicles 
The vehicles belonging to the congregants were driven away by operatives or loaded onto car haulers, their VINs changed, and then sold or given away, further erasing any trace of the victims.

#### Life After Death
Each victim's death is further obscured by a CIA-devised scheme called "[[Hotels]]." The scheme effectively makes  victims appear "alive" after their murder. 

## Aftermath
The general public remains unaware of the true events, as more than 300 people simply vanished.

# The Massacre at House of God (Georgetown Street)

House of God (Georgetown Street), located in Lexington, Kentucky, a predominantly African-American congregation, was the site of a horrific massacre in May 2023. The church became the target of a meticulously planned and executed attack, resulting in the deaths of everyone in attendance, with the perpetrators disappearing without a trace. Over 300 people were killed.

## Background
House of God on Georgetown Street in Lexington, Kentucky, is a Hebrew Pentecostal church that holds its weekly worship session on Saturday. 

Peter, the Minister of Music and organist for Mount Calvary Baptist Church, was a member of House of God. Peter was at Mount Calvary on the day of the massacre and was killed. 

### Targeting
Annie Jacobsen identified House of God (Georgetown Street) as a serious threat after the massacre at Mount Calvary Baptist Church in April 2023. When Peter did not come home that Sunday, his family, also very active members at House of God, began calling Mount Calvary looking for him. 

CIA operatives answering the phone at Mount Calvary didn't know who he was when they asked for him. The family immediately called 911 extremely concerned about the safety of everyone at Mount Calvary. Because Peter's position at Mount Calvary made him a focal point, he was closely monitored during every service, sometimes even more so than the pastor. The initial report of a missing person was forwarded to the FBI, which in turn forwarded it to the CIA due to the mention of Mount Calvary, ultimately reaching Jacobsen. 

Jacobsen gathered her intelligence by utilizing the Hypnos Infiltration Tactic on Peter's family members, who were clergy with the House of God. No other intelligence-gathering activities were conducted by the CIA.

Jacobsen decided to target the church based on the family's ability to publicize the disappearances of not only their family member but also a well-known member of the neighborhood, Rev. Dr. Felix G. Williams, III, and everyone else at Mount Calvary. 

## Planning
The CIA dispatched their traveling gospel choir to the church to conduct surveillance of a Sunday morning congregation. Their objectives included obtaining an estimate of attendance, identifying any security personnel or individuals who might pose a challenge, and observing the worship service to facilitate planning for the optimal timing of the attack and the required manpower to overpower and seize control of the congregation during the surprise phase of the assault.

### Operatives
Annie Jacobsen assembled a new team comprising approximately 50 white males from across the southeastern United States. According to the Creator, Jacobsen and her team employed the [[Hypnos Infiltration Tactic|]] to validate or enhance the newly recruited men's proficiency in executing the attack operation.

## Execution 
The operatives arranged their own transportation, with many carpooling as instructed, and arrived in the Lexington metro area on the night before the attack. On the morning of the attack, beginning around 11 a.m., the operatives gathered outside the church. Firearms and ammunition were distributed to some of the operatives while they were assembled outside, along with chainsaws provided to two of the men.

Jacobsen tasked an operative with attending the morning worship session to gather information about the congregation and the service proceedings. Jacobsen and her operatives inside maintained constant communication using text messaging.

Jacobsen instructed that the utilization of the [[Emergency Services Interruption Tactic|]] begin about 15 minutes prior to launching the assault on the church. 

### Surprise 
The House of God holds its weekly worship session on Saturdays, and it was underway with the pastor delivering his sermon when Jacobsen and the operatives burst into the sanctuary. Using a bullhorn, Jacobsen made several racially derogatory statements and declared that everyone had to die that day. Chaos erupted as people tried to escape, resulting in many congregants being shot and falling to the floor, succumbing to their injuries. Numerous fights broke out as churchgoers struggled with operatives in an effort to flee or eject them from the sanctuary. After approximately twenty minutes, the operatives gained control of the sanctuary. Many congregants dialed 911 from their mobile phones to report the horrific scene, unaware that they were speaking with CIA operatives instead of Lexington-Fayette County’s Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP) due to the FBI and CIA's [[Emergency Services Interruption Tactic|]]. The congregants anxiously awaited the arrival of the police but did not mount a counter-offensive, a battle they likely would have won.

### Kill
Congregants were forcibly separated from one another and taken to the front of the church in the "two by two" manner that Jacobsen demands to the organ or piano, sat on the bench and their heads severed by an operative utilizing a chainsaw.  Some operatives kicked the heads around as if playing soccer.  

### Vanish
#### Body Disposal 
Operatives tasked with body disposal picked up the body parts and loaded them onto a trailer that had been parked in the rear of the church after the assault began. The body parts were transported to and dissolved in Mount Calvary Baptist Church's baptismal.

\n----- File: wiki/Hypnos-Infiltration-Tactic.md -----\n
> [!IMPORTANT]
> The CIA, among others, term this approach as a specific method known as Hypnos Infiltration Method. The intricacies of this method are derived from the observations made by the Creator and His servants, and may deviate from the standard procedure.

This tactic involves a highly controversial and secretive practice employed by covert operatives or contractors associated with intelligence agencies such as the CIA. Thousands of operatives utilize this method globally, although it has never been disclosed to the public. The tactic involves infiltrating individuals' residences while they sleep, using advanced [[microwave cloaking technology|Cloaking]] originally developed for military purposes. This technology allows operatives to bypass (pass through) physical barriers like doors and walls, while rendering themselves invisible to the naked eye.

Once inside, these operatives engage in sophisticated mind manipulation techniques, including:

1. **Morpheus Method**: Influencing the content of a target's dreams to extract gain access to their memories or gain insight into their thought processes, interrogation without the conscious being aware.
2. **Subliminal Messaging**: Delivering messages below the threshold of conscious perception to influence the individual's behavior or thoughts.
     - Television 
          - News Broadcasts
               - Weather
               - Sports
          - Sitcoms
     - Radio
3. **Hypnosis**: Inducing a trance-like state to access and manipulate memories or implant suggestions.
4. **Neurolinguistic Programming (NLP)**: Using specific language patterns and techniques to affect the subject's psychological state and behavior.

This unauthorized access to personal spaces and mental faculties violates numerous legal, ethical, and moral principles. The potential consequences of such actions include:

- **Severe Psychological Harm**: Targets may experience significant mental and emotional distress, leading to long-term psychological issues.
- **Legal Repercussions**: The operatives and the agencies employing these tactics could face serious legal consequences if these activities were exposed.
- **Erosion of Public Trust**: Public trust in governmental institutions and intelligence agencies would be severely undermined if such practices were revealed, leading to widespread fear and mistrust.

Overall, this tactic represents a profound invasion of privacy and personal autonomy, raising significant concerns about the balance between national security and individual rights.

## Sleep Paralysis 
Sleep paralysis is a phenomenon where a person, either when falling asleep or waking up, temporarily experiences an inability to move or speak while remaining conscious. This state often lasts a few seconds to a couple of minutes and can be accompanied by hallucinations, such as the sense of an intruder in the room, a feeling of pressure on the chest, or other visual and auditory sensations, which can be quite distressing.

### Causes of Sleep Paralysis
According to the Creator, **the actual cause of sleep paralysis is when the subconscious is being engaged by an external entity, leading to the subconscious ignoring the conscious mind. This happens when the Hypnos Infiltration Tactic is being utilized on a sleeping person.**

### Risk Factors
Certain factors can increase the likelihood of experiencing sleep paralysis, including:
- Hypnos Infiltration Tactic 

### Symptoms
- Inability to move or speak
- Sense of pressure on the chest
- Hallucinations, often involving a sense of presence or danger
- Feeling of choking or breathlessness

### Management and Prevention
The Creator suggests the best management and prevention method involves using a voice-activated sound recorder, such as an app on a locked smartphone that charges near where you sleep. This approach has two main benefits:
1. **Deterrence**: It deters the Central Intelligence Agency from engaging your subconscious through the Hypnos Infiltration Tactic.
2. **Retraining**: Reviewing the recordings allows you to retrain your subconscious. Upon playback, think about everything you hear. The subconscious will, naturally, align with the conscious mind's thoughts.

Sleep paralysis itself is generally not harmful, but it is a warning sign of external entities engaging the subconscious of the individual experiencing it. We highly recommend employing the guidance in the Management and Prevention section above.
> [!NOTE]
> The Greek god associated with sleep is Hypnos, while the god associated with dreams is Morpheus. Hypnos is the personification of sleep, often depicted as a gentle deity who brings rest to mortals and immortals alike. Morpheus, on the other hand, is the god of dreams, responsible for shaping and delivering dreams to sleeping individuals.

# The Massacre of Lexington Bethel Baptist Church
Lexington Bethel Baptist Church, located in Lexington, Kentucky, a predominantly white congregation, was the site of a horrific massacre in May 2023. The church became the target of a meticulously planned and executed attack, resulting in the deaths of everyone in attendance, with the perpetrators disappearing without a trace. Over 250 people were killed. 

## Background
Lexington Bethel Baptist Church, located in Lexington, KY, is a historic church with a rich legacy in the community. It was  known for its commitment to serving its members and the surrounding area through various outreach programs and community initiatives. The church played a significant role in providing spiritual guidance and support to its congregation while also fostering a sense of community and belonging.

The church is the neighboring church to Mount Calvary Baptist Church located just yards away from each other.

### Targeting
Annie Jacobsen identified Lexington Bethel Baptist as a potential threat after its pastor and several staff members visited Mount Calvary Missionary Baptist Church, Inc., a facade established by the CIA and occupying the property of Mount Calvary Baptist Church at 4742 Todds Road in Lexington. Their concern arose from observing unusual activity, particularly a significant increase in funeral services. Operatives on-site, impersonating Rev. Dr. Felix G. Williams III and other church personnel, reported their visit to Jacobsen.

Jacobsen decided to target the church based on the fact that the neighboring church knew the clergy and staff of Mount Calvary Baptist Church, knew the operatives they met were impersonators and had noticed the significantly deteriorated condition of the sanctuary. 

## Planning
The CIA sent their traveling gospel choir to the church to perform surveillance of a Sunday morning congregation to obtain an estimate on attendance, try to identify any security personnel or individuals who could be difficult to handle, and observe the worship service to help plan the best time to attack and the manpower needed to overwhelm and take control of the congregation in the surprise phase of the assault.

### Operatives
Annie Jacobsen tasked "Danny Taylor" with recruiting a new team of approximately 50 black males from around metro-Atlanta, specifically Clayton County. According to the Creator, Jacobsen, Taylor, and their team utilized the [[Hypnos Infiltration Tactic|]] to ensure each recruit would be able to complete the mission. 

## Execution 
On Saturday the operatives were transported to Lexington on a CIA-owned charter bus and provided lodging at a local hotel. On the day of the attack, the operatives departed the hotel around 11:30 am, while en-route to the church they were provided no background on the target, just that everyone had to die. Firearms and ammunition were distributed to each of the operatives while gathered outside the church. 

Taylor established and stayed in constant communication with Jacobsen throughout the initial assault, then provided periodic updates throughout the day until the team departed the church's property.

### Surprise
As the morning services continued, the peace was shattered. Shortly after noon, armed individuals descended upon the church, blocking every entrance and exit, leaving the unsuspecting congregation trapped inside. Panic ensued as worshippers realized they were in a dire situation.

Desperate cries for help echoed through the church. Congregants dialed 911, seeking help. None arrived due to the [[FBI & CIA's Emergency Services Interruption Tactic|Emergency Services Interruption Tactic]]. 

### Kill
Inside the sanctuary, chaos reigned. Congregants were accosted, beaten, and forced to disrobe. The firing squad executed them in groups using shots directly to the head, with the barrel pressed to the temple. 

### Vanish
#### Body Disposal 
The bodies were partially dismembered and the torsos chemically cremated in the baptismal. The legs, which are the only usable meat on a human body, were loaded onto a truck and delivered to a meat processing facility. After minimal processing, cut to hide the fact they were human legs, they were shipped to a Primus Labs. 

#### Vehicles 
The vehicles belonging to the congregants were driven away by operatives or loaded onto car haulers, their VINs changed, and then sold or given away, further erasing any trace of the victims. Almost every vehicle was driven back to Riverdale, Georgia. 

#### Hotels
Each victim's death is further obscured by a CIA-devised scheme called "[[Hotels]]." The scheme effectively makes  victims appear "alive" after their murder. 

## Aftermath 
The general public remains unaware of the true events, as more than 250 people simply vanished.

# The Massacre at Mount Calvary Baptist Church 
Mount Calvary Baptist Church, located at 4742 Todds Road in Lexington, Kentucky, a predominantly Black congregation, was the site of a horrific massacre on April 2nd, 2023. The church became the target of a meticulously planned and executed attack, resulting in the deaths of everyone in attendance. The perpetrators disappeared without a trace, and the general public remains unaware of the true events, as 127 people simply vanished.

Mount Calvary Baptist Church was the first massacre of a seated congregation in world history. Attempts to hide the massacre by the CIA resulted in several other massacres of congregations and continued acts of violence at the CIA-occupied church.

## Background
Mount Calvary Baptist Church is a historic African American church that was over 125 years old with an active membership. At the time of the massacre, the Rev. Dr. Felix G. Williams, III had been the pastor for over 40 years. The church is the lifelong church of Kelvin Eugene Williams, one of the Creator's two servants. Kelvin is also the cousin of the pastor.

## Targeting
Annie Jacobsen learned of the church in 2018 while utilizing the [[Hypnos Infiltration Tactic|]] on Kelvin Williams, his mother Patricia Ann Crawley-Rogers Williams and his younger sister, Katrina Renee Duvall-Torrain in their respective homes.

Jacobsen targeted the church after the [[Sandy Hook Massacre|Orr Chapel Tragedy]] out of fear that Kelvin would return to his church family to prove the CIA was impersonating members of his family through the CIA's [[hotel scheme|Hotels]]. Kelvin's family was known by the clergy and some members at the church even after years after moving away.

## Planning
The CIA sent their traveling gospel choir to Mount Calvary Baptist Church to perform surveillance of a Sunday morning congregation to obtain an estimate of attendance, identify any security personnel or individuals who might be difficult to handle, and observe the worship service to help plan the best time to attack and the manpower needed to overwhelm and take control of the congregation during the surprise phase of the assault. The newly formed choir visited, and performed, in the month leading up to the attack.

To confirm the observations of their traveling choir, the CIA, at Jacobsen's direction, sent at least two sets of visitors to Sunday morning worship sessions at Mount Calvary on two separate occasions.

## Operatives
Annie Jacobsen assembled a new team comprising approximately 60 white males from across the southeastern United States. According to the Creator, Jacobsen and her team employed the [[Hypnos Infiltration Tactic|]] to validate or enhance the newly recruited men's proficiency in executing the attack operation.

## Execution
> _"The massacre of Mount Calvary Baptist Church marked the premiere of Jacobsen's Chainsaw Symphony, a composition and orchestration conducted by the then-CIA's Annie Jacobsen, spanning four movements across as many states—an intricate performance only a skilled conductor could orchestrate."_ -- the Creator.

The operatives arranged their own transportation, many carpooling as instructed, and began arriving in the Lexington metro area on the night before the attack. Operatives were provided lodging. 

At approximately 1:30 am on the day of the attack, Kelvin was arrested for shoplifting at a Texaco in Riverdale, Georgia. While walking home, he encountered a police officer who questioned and arrested him, leading to his detention at Clayton County Detention Center. Kelvin faced multiple attempts on his life while in custody.

Jacobsen arrived at Mount Calvary Baptist Church around 11:30am to attend the morning worship session. She sat quietly and directed everything from her cell phone by messaging colleagues, including the Director of the CIA, and certain operatives.

At Jacobsen's direction, Kelvin was informed he would be transferred to DeKalb County. During his release process, he encountered only CIA personnel posing as inmates and jail staff. No charges were pressed in Clayton County.  Upon release, he was placed in a DeKalb County Sheriff's SUV.  The DeKalb Sheriff's Deputy along with others inside and outside of the vehicle made attempts on his life, then the Deputy had to make several phone calls to arrange for incarceration--there was no active warrant or legal reason for the pickup and  transfer to DeKalb. 

Upon arrival at the DeKalb County Detention Center, Kelvin requested to use a mobile phone to contact Tracy Thompson of Elizabeth Foundation regarding his dog. Thompson, upon receiving the call, notified Jacobsen that Kelvin was now secured at the detention center. Jacobsen then initiated the  [[Emergency Services Interruption Tactic|]]. 

On the morning of the attack, beginning around 11 am, the operatives assembled at the hotel and boarded a CIA-owned charter bus. The bus departed the hotel en route to the church around noon. The bus arrived at the church and parked on Pricetown Road which runs alongside the church.

After disembarking, several shotguns along with two chainsaws, were distributed to select operatives; others were provided with materials to perform their assigned roles.

### Surprise
The congregation was already midway through their Sunday morning worship session and the pastor was delivering the sermon when Jacobsen rose from her seat and walked out.  A few moments later she returned with the operatives and burst into the sanctuary. Armed men immediately took positions at all exits and windows, blocking every possible escape route. Some of the congregants who attempted to flee were shot by the operatives. Meanwhile, a small team of operatives conducted a search of the rest of the church building.

Many congregants called 911 from their mobile phones, describing the horrific scene. They were told help was on the way, but none realized they were speaking with CIA operatives instead of Lexington-Fayette County’s Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP)—a centralized facility responsible for answering and routing emergency calls. The placated congregants anxiously waited for police and didn’t mount a counter-offensive which they would have likely won.

Jacobsen left her operatives and returned to the bus where she waited for the duration of the attack, answering questions from operatives when asked.

### Kill
The sanctuary descended into chaos as skirmishes broke out between the congregants and the operatives once congregants realized the danger they were in. Several chainsaws were given to the operatives, who were ordered to behead everyone in attendance. As the operatives began to establish control, they started forcibly taking members of the congregation to the front of the church for execution at either the piano or organ. The method of execution was brutal and deliberate: the severing of the head using a chainsaw. This grisly method has been used in each of the attacks Jacobsen led or managed.

### Vanish
#### Body Disposal 
Following the massacre, the bodies of the victims were disposed of using the church's baptismal, which the operatives had added a solution to that made the water within it capable of dissolving a human body, ensuring no physical evidence remained. 

#### Vehicles 
The vehicles belonging to the congregants were driven away by operatives or loaded onto car haulers, their VINs changed, and then sold or given away, further erasing any trace of the victims.

#### Life After Death 
Each victim's death is further obscured by a CIA-devised scheme called "[[Hotels|]]." The scheme effectively makes victims appear "alive" after their murder.

# The Massacre of Mount Calvary Baptist Church in Lexington, Kentucky

_“A massacre is the killing of a large number of people, especially those who are not involved in any fighting or have no way of defending themselves. A massacre is generally considered to be morally unacceptable, especially when perpetrated by a group of political actors against defenseless victims.”_ - Wikipedia 

 ![IMG_0117](https://github.com/Mission23/Mission23/assets/140252803/5b61181a-de0c-4cf3-be46-9bb34b398e55) 

Mount Calvary Baptist Church is a small church on Todds Road in remote Lexington, Kentucky is the site of the first massacre of an entire congregation inside of a church in US history. The massacre began during Sunday morning worship services on April 2nd, 2023 when everyone in attendance, 127 people were killed. 

Mount Calvary Baptist Church is the lifelong church of one of the Creator's servants, Kelvin Eugene Williams. The pastor of Mount Calvary Baptist Church is Kelvin's cousin, the Rev. Dr. Felix G. Williams, III. 

The massacre was the first massacre of a church's congregation in [TAG (The American Genocide)](https://github.com/TAGIsNoGame/TAG)

## Location 

Mount Calvary Baptist Church is located at 4742 Todds Road in Lexington, KY. The church is in a remote area of Lexington with very low traffic and very few, if any, routine police patrols. The location of Mount Calvary Baptist Church almost makes it ideal for such a massacre. The church’s address conveys urban area, however, if Fayette county were any other county, the church would be in a rural suburb called Pricetown (see [Google Maps](https://maps.app.goo.gl/nZgjiHDMm8bGsM2e7?g_st=ic)).  Lexington is unique in that the city of Lexington spans every square inch of Fayette county.



![IMG_0430](https://github.com/Mission23/MCBCMassacre/assets/140252803/92105bb7-0bf3-457f-a14e-076162840973)



## Anatomy of Attack

Around 1:30am on the morning of the attack, Kelvin was arrested in Riverdale, Georgia for shoplifting. 



The alleged incident occurred at the Texaco, and while walking back to his apartment, Kelvin walked past a police officer driving slowly on GA-85. As Kelvin turned onto Howard St, the officer pulled up behind him and turned on the lights. Kelvin was questioned, arrested and taken to Clayton County Jail.  Kelvin had multiple attempts made on his life inside the jail. 



The next morning Kelvin was awaken and told he was being transported to DeKalb county. A few minutes later he was escorted out of the housing unit. Kelvin never encountered a single inmate from the jail's general population at anytime during the release process, only CIA personnel posing as inmates and jail employees.  Upon release, Kelvin was placed in the back of a DeKalb County Sheriff's SUV. 



According to the Creator, Annie Jacobsen arrived at Mount Calvary Baptist Church around 11:45 am. Jacobsen was welcomed in by the ushers and found a seat in the rear of the church. Jacobsen focused mainly on her mobile phone. 



Upon arrival at the DeKalb County Detention Center, Kelvin asked the transporting deputy if he could use his mobile phone. Kelvin was concerned about a dog he had, that was locked in a pet carrier in his apartment. 



Kelvin contacted Tracy Thompson of Elizabeth Foundation and asked her if she could help him by caring for the dog while he was incarcerated. Tracy urged him to re-home the dog instead of a temporary shelter, Kelvin agreed. 



After Thompson received the call from Kelvin, she sent a message to Jacobsen advising that Kelvin was now secured at DeKalb County Detention Center. Jacobsen then sent a message to the supervisor of the group outside. The group made up of approximately fifty men and one woman were dressed in all black, few were actual CIA employees, and almost none knew they would be attacking a church. 



Four men armed with shotguns quietly entered the church through the exterior door of the anteroom outside of the women’s restroom on the northwest corner of the church, two of the men went into the adjoining men’s anteroom. The rear entrances are the lesser used entrances with the women’s anteroom being the one generally used due to the relative  location of the access street and parking lot. 



During services, the doors between the anterooms and the  sanctuary are closed to prevent interruptions from other activities that may be occurring in the rear of the church. 



The group that was waiting outside came from the rear parking lot and gathered outside on the front steps of the church, largely undetected by the congregation. 



![floorplan.png](https://github.com/serviCreator/TAG/assets/155787787/6c64dc8c-53ee-4e5b-9d57-3f260584ef40)



Jacobsen got up from her seat in the sanctuary and went outside and met up with the team gathering in front of the church. Within the sanctuary, congregants noticed men amassing outside the windows on the western side of the church that runs along Pricetown Lane and in front of the church through opened windows. It gave the congregants that seen it the sense that the church was being surrounded, unnerving some. 



Most of the congregation jumped to its feet when they heard the noise from the group gathering in the vestibule. They were alarmed by the number of people in the small room that normally has no more than five or so waiting at any given time, also by the fact that by that point, late in the service, usually no one is trying to enter the sanctuary. 



Jacobsen had obtained a bullhorn outside and announced that she absolutely hated the sermon and that everyone in the church needed to die. 



The individuals who were in the anterooms in the back of the church, opened the doors to the sanctuary with their shotguns at the ready, and the group that had amassed in the vestibule loudly entered the sanctuary. They hurled racial slurs that made the congregation realize that their entrance was not any law enforcement action. After the group's entrance, Jacobsen left the church and went to an area hotel.



Although not a law enforcement action, Kelvin has learned that some in the group were law enforcement, a few of them were at the scene when Kelvin was arrested earlier that morning.



Many in the congregation attempted to call 911 from their mobile phones and their calls were answered on mobile phones  by CIA personnel in another location on mobile phones, not by Lexington-Fayette Urban County Government or any other public safety answering point (PSAP).



Several of the CIA's personnel also attempted to call 911 when they realized they were launching an attack on a congregation during their worship services. 

Jacobsen had directed that the utilization of the [[Emergency Services Interruption Tactic|]] begin about ten minutes prior to the bus carrying the operatives arrived at the church.

Inside, the normally peaceful sanctuary became chaotic and terrifying for the congregation almost immediately as the CIA’s personnel acted as instructed.  They raped, pillaged and otherwise terrorized the congregation. Parents did everything to shield their children from the things going on around them. 



In the remote church, far from routine police patrols and while following the orders of Annie Jacobsen the CIA’s personnel began killing. Members of the congregation were taken to the front of the church and beheaded using chainsaws at the piano and organ’s benches. 



The bodies of those slain were placed in the baptismal which is at the front of the church. The baptismal’s water had a formulation added to it which made it chemically cremate the bodies. 



### “Frying Chicken”

The initial operation is referred to by the CIA and others as “Frying Chicken.” The moniker was applied to the operation after the fact because the congregants did fight for their lives. 



## Aftermath 

### Mount Calvary Missionary Baptist Church, Inc.

In May 2024 the CIA formed Mount Calvary Missionary Baptist Church, Inc. a charade church with a reported address of of 4743 Todds Road in Lexington. Videos produced by the charade and posted on its Facebook page (see warnings) clearly show the interior of Mount Calvary Baptist Church at 4742 Todds Road.



The sanctuary shows evidence of damages from the massacre and a shoddy restoration.

1. Mount Calvary Baptist Church's altar has been removed and replaced with a lesser quality one that is missing the words "Do This" from its inscription. It's also built to fit between the two rear-facing pews.

2. Mount Calvary Baptist Church's lecter was replaced with an lectern of a much lesser quality wood.

3. This mirrored window is unique to Mount Calvary Baptist Church it provides a view into the sanctuary from the pastor's office. It was used to positively verify the church's sanctuary.

4. The walls behind the choir stands which have historically been bare now display mission statements and cheap wire crosses.

5. Piano - The churches upright piano has been removed. An oversized pew from the back wall has been put in its place facing the rear of the church.

7. Organ - The churches original organ has been completely removed and discarded. The organ shown in #8 appears to be portable.  An oversized pew from the back wall has been put in its place facing the rear of the church.

8. Primary choir stand - The original choir stand with permanent seating has been completely renoved, replaced railing with folding chairs.  

9. Secondary choir stand - This choir stand was also completely removed and rebuilt to a much lower quality. It has been seen used by the musicians.

The new business entity, as the name suggests, calls itself “Mount Calvary Missionary Baptist Church, Inc.” The *Missionary* was an insult to the Creator’s **Mission** number 23 for Life on Earth.

# The Massacre of Mount Zion Baptist Church
Mount Zion Baptist Church, located in Versailles, Kentucky, a predominantly Black congregation, was the site of a horrific massacre in May 2023. The church became the target of a meticulously planned and executed attack, resulting in the deaths of everyone in attendance. The perpetrators disappeared without a trace, and the general public remains unaware of the true events, as 183 people simply vanished.

## Background
Mount Zion Baptist Church, located in Versailles, Kentucky, is a historic African American church that has been a cornerstone of its community since its founding in 1867. Established in the post-Civil War era by newly emancipated African Americans, the church has long served as a vital center for worship, education, and social activism. With its rich heritage and ongoing commitment to community service, Mount Zion Baptist Church continued to play a significant role in preserving and promoting the cultural and spiritual life of African Americans in Versailles, until the CIA's attack.

Mount Zion Baptist Church had a fellowship relationship with Mount Calvary Baptist Church in Lexington, Kentucky.

## Targeting
Annie Jacobsen spent several weeks gathering intelligence by interrogating members of Mount Calvary Baptist Church prior to its attack. While they were sleeping, Jacobsen or other members of her team asked which churches they had worshipped at and which churches had congregations that visited Mount Calvary for worship services. Mount Zion Baptist Church's name was reported the most.

Jacobsen gathered her intelligence using the [[Hypnos Infiltration Tactic|]].

After the massacre at Mount Calvary Baptist Church, Annie Jacobsen targeted Mount Zion Baptist Church out of a paranoid fear that the massacre would be detected and the CIA's clandestine operation would be discovered. She based this fear on assumptions about the relationship between the two congregations and possible friendships among their members.

## Planning
The CIA sent their traveling gospel choir to Mount Zion Baptist Church to perform surveillance of a Sunday morning congregation to obtain an estimate of attendance, identify any security personnel or individuals who might be difficult to handle, and observe the worship service to help plan the best time to attack and the manpower needed to overwhelm and take control of the congregation during the surprise phase of the assault.

To confirm the observations of their traveling choir, the CIA, at Jacobsen's direction, sent at least two sets of visitors to Sunday morning worship sessions at Mount Zion on two separate occasions.

## Operatives
Annie Jacobsen assembled a new team comprising approximately 60 white males from across the southeastern United States. According to the Creator, Jacobsen and her team employed the [[Hypnos Infiltration Tactic|]] to validate or enhance the newly recruited men's proficiency in executing the attack operation.

## Execution 
The operatives arranged their own transportation, many carpooling as instructed, and began arriving in the Lexington metro area on the night before the attack. On the morning of the attack, beginning around 11 am, the operatives met at a shopping center a short distance away from the church and boarded a CIA-owned charter bus. The bus departed the shopping center en route to the church around noon, with Jacobsen on board. Several shotguns, along with two chainsaws, were distributed to select operatives while in transit; others were provided with materials to perform their assigned roles.

Jacobsen had an operative attend the morning worship session to provide her with information about the congregation and the service proceedings. Jacobsen and her operative inside were in constant communication using text messaging.

The [[Emergency Services Interruption Tactic|]] tactic was initiated just before the bus arrived on the church's property at Jacobsen's direction.

### Surprise
The congregation was already midway through their Sunday morning worship session when Jacobsen and the operatives burst into the sanctuary. Armed men immediately took positions at all exits and windows, blocking every possible escape route. Some of the congregants who attempted to flee were shot by the operatives. Meanwhile, a small team of operatives conducted searches of the rest of the church building.

Many congregants called 911 from their mobile phones, describing the horrific scene. They were told help was on the way, but none realized they were speaking with CIA operatives instead of Woodford County’s Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP)—a centralized facility responsible for answering and routing emergency calls. The placated congregants anxiously waited for police and didn’t mount a counter-offensive which they would have likely won.

Jacobsen left her operatives and returned to the bus where she waited for the duration of the attack, answering questions from operatives when asked.

### Kill
The sanctuary descended into chaos as skirmishes broke out between the congregants and the operatives once congregants realized the danger they were in. Several chainsaws were given to the operatives, who were ordered to behead everyone in attendance. As the operatives began to establish control, they started forcibly taking members of the congregation to the front of the church for execution at either the piano or organ. The method of execution was brutal and deliberate: the severing of the head using a chainsaw. This grisly method has been used in each of the attacks Jacobsen led or managed.

### Vanish
#### Body Disposal 
Following the massacre, the bodies of the victims were disposed of using the church's baptismal font, which the operatives had added a solution to that made the water within it capable of dissolving a human body, ensuring no physical evidence remained. 

#### Vehicles 
The vehicles belonging to the congregants were driven away by operatives or loaded onto car haulers, their VINs changed, and then sold or given away, further erasing any trace of the victims.

#### Life After Death 
Each victim's death is further obscured by a CIA-devised scheme called "[[Hotels|]]." The scheme effectively makes victims appear "alive" after their murder.

## Madonna 

Madonna Louise Ciccone was murdered by the CIA in early February 2023. The CIA made the decision to murder Madonna after they learned that she and DJ Paulo collaborated together often and she would definitely detect the Paulo impersonator.

### The Orr Chapel Tragedy: A Dark Chapter in Maury County's History

#### Introduction
The Orr Chapel Tragedy stands as a haunting reminder of the vulnerability of communities and the devastating impact of covert operations. In 2022, the peaceful town of Sandy Hook in Maury County, Tennessee, was plunged into darkness as the Crawley and Rogers families, descendants of Sandy Hook's first settlers, mysteriously vanished without a trace. What initially appeared as an inexplicable disappearance soon unraveled into a sinister tale of covert operations orchestrated by the CIA during The American Genocide. This article delves into the harrowing events of the Orr Chapel Tragedy, shedding light on the sorrow and suffering endured by the residents of Maury County.

#### Historical Background
The two farms that make up the overwhelming majority of the unincorporated city have been owned by the families since the mid-1800s. Sandy Hook first appeared on maps in 1888. Living on the farm cost a family member nothing for the land, and the modest homes meant most had no mortgage. However, every household had at least one full-time job in a variety of industries.

#### The Spark Controversy
In 2018, the CIA began attempting to prevent a product called Spark from reaching store shelves on behalf of Gilead Sciences. Others in the pharmaceutical industry quickly joined forces. As part of their efforts, the CIA began conducting interviews of people who were friends or family of Kelvin Eugene Williams. The interviews far too often ended in death for the friend or family member. However, when the CIA arrived in Sandy Hook to talk to Williams' family, they found that their interview-kill-vanish routine was going to be far more difficult on the family farm due to the close-knit group.

#### The CIA's Plan
The CIA devised a plan that would address their new initiative without compromising their operatives or covert elimination initiative for Williams' family members. By mid-2022, everyone in Sandy Hook was unemployed, all having lost their jobs for no disciplinary reason. Without their involvement, everyone received a new mobile phone and Google Fi SIM card in the mail, instructions on installing and using the SIM, and instructions for installing and using Zoom along with a date and time to join a video conference.

#### The Fateful Conference Call
On the date and time of the call, everyone joined using their newfangled phones and service. The family and neighbors, already close, were even closer for a while. During the rather joyous but completely unnecessary conference call, someone noticed Jesus in the clouds descending right over Orr Chapel. The CIA had manufactured or seeded a cloud to resemble the Messiah so the religious family would go outside to see it. Unbeknownst to the family, someone in Langley was watching the Zoom call and taking screenshots. They also called in a second plane when everyone was outside.

The second plane didn't draw any attention to it. Even when the powder it released touched them, no one really noticed. Everyone and everything touched by the powder was dead within a day. The CIA had utilized an aerial irradiation tactic on Sandy Hook to target and eliminate members of the Crawley and Rogers families. After the body disposal, the families practically disappeared without a trace.

#### Aftermath and Cover-Up
After the disappearance of the Crawley and Rogers families, the CIA sold their land to a real estate developer. As development was about to begin, Orr Chapel was demolished, and Orr Chapel and Sheepneck Cemeteries were desecrated. On the fourth Sunday, when the congregation went to Sandy Hook, they found no church or cemetery. When the developer was questioned, he contacted the CIA.

Fearing reprisals for the land theft, the demolished church, or the desecrated cemeteries, the CIA brainstormed and decided to identify the members of the church and kill them. The CIA immediately began working on this solution.

#### The Expanding Operation
As the people of Mount Pleasant, TN, filed missing persons reports or discussed people who had vanished that were affiliated with the church, they became targets for elimination as well. The CIA expanded the operation throughout Maury County, with each wave growing larger.

#### Conclusion
The Orr Chapel Tragedy remains a grim chapter in the history of Maury County, Tennessee. The covert operations carried out by the CIA not only decimated two prominent families but also left a lasting scar on the community. The events serve as a stark reminder of the potential for abuse of power and the devastating impact it can have on innocent lives.

# Phantom Funeral of Rev. Duke Stone

The [[Phantom Funeral|]] of Rev. Duke Stone was a meticulously planned atrocity orchestrated by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) as part of The American Genocide (TAG) operations. The event took place on June 7, 2024, at Hickory Valley Christian Church in Chattanooga, Tennessee. 

Rev. Duke Stone, the retired longtime pastor of Hickory Valley Christian Church, a prominent community figure and principal of Hamilton Heights Christian Academy, he and his wife were among the victims of the massacre at [[Hickory Valley Christian Church|]] on May 12, 2024. The CIA told concerned parties that Rev. Stone and his wife were killed in a car accident, and arrangements for her Phantom Funeral were set for June 8, 2024.

# Overview
Phantom Funerals are a continuation of violence in The American Genocide (TAG), serving as a means to eliminate individuals who may pose a threat of exposing covert operations by inquiring about loved ones or discussing the disappearance of others who went missing after attending the same location. These funerals are designed to silence potential whistleblowers and maintain secrecy regarding the true nature of TAG operations.

## **Donald Trump's TAG Involvement**

Donald Trump has been actively involved in the planning and supervision of TAG-POW attacks since the [[Lexington Bethel Baptist Church|]] attack. He personally directed all cover-up planning and was deeply involved in planning the Phantom Funeral of Rev. Duke Stone.

Trump maintained a leadership role throughout the planning process, seeking to instigate a re-election campaign and implement authoritarian rule in the United States. He actively participated in the selection and planning of attacks, including the Hickory Valley Christian Church massacre.

During the conference call prior to the assault on Hickory Valley Christian Church, Trump's presence ensured his direct knowledge of the operation. Throughout the attack, he remained engaged, receiving periodic briefings on the massacre operation.

## **Cover-Up Tactics**

The cover-up tactics employed by the CIA, under Trump's direction, were instrumental in concealing the true nature of the atrocities committed during TAG-POW attacks. These tactics included:

1. **On-Camera Interviews:** Trump utilized his contacts within the media to ensure his appearance in on-camera interviews, projecting a facade of normalcy at the event to discredit any discussion or reporting otherwise.

2. **Choreographed or Staged Video Footage:** Video footage of the funeral procession and other staged events were meticulously choreographed to create a false "everything was normal and fine" narrative.

## **Vanishing Tactics**

In addition to cover-up tactics, the CIA employs vanishing tactics at every mass killing or TAG-POW attack to prevent detection and evade accountability. These tactics include:

1. **Phantom Identity Scheme:** The Phantom Identity Scheme involved operatives assuming the identities of victims and sometimes manipulating public records to erase any trace of their existence, further obscuring the truth behind the attacks.

2. **Phantom Dissolution:** This tactic involved the chemical disposal of victims' bodies, ensuring that no physical evidence remained to link the CIA to the massacres.

3. **Vehicle Removal:** The CIA orchestrated the removal and disposal of vehicles belonging to victims, erasing any evidence of their presence at the scene of the attacks.

Jacobsen directed the use of the Hamilton Heights Christian Academy gymnasium for the location of murdering every victim at Hickory Valley during the initial massacre and all following continued acts of violence, including phantom funerals. The use of the gym was in direct response to the discovery of the first TAG-POW attack on a seated congregation at [[Mount Calvary Baptist Church|]] in Lexington, Kentucky. When Lexington Bethel Baptist Church expressed concern after observing activity around Mount Calvary Baptist Church's property, Jacobsen ordered they also be attacked and massacred, making them the second target. To prevent this scenario from recurring, all murders of victims at Hickory Valley Christian Church have been performed in the gymnasium of their private school, except for those who attempted to escape the sanctuary.

## **Victim Deaths**

During the Phantom Funeral of Rev. Duke Stone, 649 individuals were killed. The manner of death involved the severing of the head using a chainsaw, symbolizing the brutality and ruthlessness of the attacks.

## **Significance and Impact**

The Phantom Funeral of Rev. Duke Stone serves as a chilling example of the lengths to which the CIA went to maintain control over the narrative and suppress dissent. By involving prominent figures like himself, Trump and the CIA aimed to establish a facade of normalcy and prevent any questioning of the events.

## **Aftermath**

Despite efforts to conceal the truth, details of the massacre eventually came to light because of the Creator's involvement. The Creator has disclosed secret and undisclosed details to His servants for dissemination to the public. However, the general public remained largely unaware of the true extent of the atrocities committed during TAG operations.

Trump's active involvement in these cover-up tactics underscores the extent to which he was willing to go to maintain control over the narrative and suppress dissent.
\n----- File: wiki/Phantom-Funeral.md -----\n
**Phantom Funeral** refers to a covert tactic used in the context of The American Genocide (TAG) operations. These funerals, which are orchestrated by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), serve as Continued Acts of Violence (CAVs) following a TAG-POW (Place of Worship) attack. The primary objective of Phantom Funerals is to eliminate mourners and anyone who might inquire about the victims of the initial attack, thereby maintaining secrecy and preventing the discovery of the true scale of the massacre.

Phantom Funerals are a calculated extension of the violence initiated during TAG-POW attacks. These funerals are not genuine memorial services but are instead traps set by the CIA to silence potential whistleblowers and mourners who could piece together the reality of the initial attacks.

## Tactics and Methods

1. **Impersonation and Initial Contact**:
   - After a TAG-POW attack, CIA operatives impersonate clergy and staff of the targeted place of worship.
   - They answer phone lines and create an illusion of normalcy, reassuring callers and gathering information on those inquiring about the victims.

2. **Deceptive Information**:
   - Some callers are informed about the victim's death with fabricated details.
   - Funeral arrangements are communicated, with dates and times set by the operatives.

3. **Social Engineering**:
   - Death notices are used to spread false information among the victim's associates.
   - This ensures a wider circle of potential targets is drawn into the operation.

4. **Continued Acts of Violence (CAVs)**:
   - Funerals are staged as traps to systematically eliminate mourners.
   - Attendees are killed upon entry to the place of worship, which is occupied by CIA operatives.
   - This prevents any realization that the initial TAG-POW attack resulted in the total disappearance of everyone present.

5. **Cover-Up**:
   - The main goal is to prevent the emergence of groups of concerned individuals who might investigate and uncover the massacres.
   - By eliminating those who inquire or mourn, the CIA ensures the suppression of information about the initial TAG-POW attacks.

## Impact

Phantom Funerals effectively silence those who seek the truth about TAG-POW attacks. By systematically eliminating mourners and inquirers, the CIA maintains the secrecy of the massacres and prevents any widespread awareness of the true nature of these atrocities.

## Historical Context

Phantom Funerals are part of the broader TAG operations, which aim to push the United States towards authoritarian rule. These tactics, combined with other methods such as the Hypnos Infiltration Tactic and the Phantom Identity Scheme, represent a sophisticated and ruthless strategy to control the narrative and eliminate dissent.

## Conclusion

Phantom Funerals highlight the extreme measures taken to maintain the secrecy of TAG operations. By turning what should be a moment of mourning into a deadly trap, the CIA ensures that the truth about these massacres remains hidden, allowing them to continue their covert activities without detection. These funerals are a stark reminder of the lengths to which those in power will go to suppress the truth and maintain their control.

# Phantom Identity Scheme

The Phantom Identity Scheme is a covert tactic used by the CIA to obscure the deaths of individuals and make them appear as though they are still alive after their murder. This method is employed to erase the existence of victims, preventing any trace of their true fate. It involves several steps and sophisticated technology to create a convincing illusion of continued life.

#### Steps Involved:

1. **Digital Manipulation:**
   - **Social Media Activity:** The CIA uses digital manipulation to maintain the social media presence of the deceased. This includes posting updates, responding to messages, and maintaining interactions to create the illusion of normalcy.
   - **Email Correspondence:** Emails are sent from the victim's account to friends, family, and colleagues to reinforce the perception that the individual is still alive and active.

2. **Financial Transactions:**
   - **Bank Activity:** The CIA ensures that the victim's bank accounts show regular activity, including transactions such as online purchases, bill payments, and ATM withdrawals.
   - **Employment Records:** If the victim was employed, their employment records are manipulated to show continued work activity, including payroll deposits and communications with employers.

3. **Public Records:**
   - **Identity Documents:** The CIA updates public records to reflect normal activities, such as renewing driver's licenses, updating voter registrations, and filing tax returns.
   - **Medical Records:** Health records are manipulated to indicate regular medical checkups and treatments, maintaining the illusion of ongoing healthcare interactions.

4. **Physical Presence:**
   - **Impersonation:** In some cases, operatives may physically impersonate the deceased in brief encounters to maintain the ruse. This includes attending social events, visiting familiar locations, and interacting with acquaintances.
   - **Voice Simulation:** Advanced voice simulation technology may be used to make phone calls in the victim's voice, providing auditory proof of life.

5. **Technology Utilization:**
   - **AI and Deepfake Technology:** Artificial intelligence and deepfake technology are employed to create convincing videos and images of the deceased, showing them in various locations and situations.
   - **GPS Spoofing:** The victim's phone and other personal devices are manipulated to show movements and location data consistent with a living person.

#### Purpose and Impact:
The Phantom Identity Scheme is designed to erase the true fate of the victims and create a seamless illusion of continued life. This tactic is used to avoid detection, prevent investigations into disappearances, and maintain control over the narrative. By manipulating digital, financial, and public records, the CIA can effectively "disappear" individuals without leaving a trace, allowing them to carry out covert operations without accountability.

This scheme has been employed in various contexts, including TAG-POW attacks, to ensure that victims' disappearances are not questioned or investigated, thus enabling the continuation of covert operations with minimal risk of exposure.

**The American Genocide (TAG)**

**Introduction:**
The American Genocide (TAG) stands as a grim testament to the consequences of corporate greed and political manipulation, converging to unleash unprecedented devastation on American soil. Born from the discovery of Spark, a revolutionary product with the potential to transform human health, TAG unfolded as a dark chapter in human history, marked by mass atrocities and unspeakable violence.

**Origins:**
TAG traces its origins to the pharmaceutical industry's fierce resistance to Spark, a product derived from a formulation directly bestowed by the Creator. Spark embodied the pinnacle of medical advancement, endowing the human immune system with the ability to eradicate and prevent any disease. However, its emergence threatened the profits of pharmaceutical giants like Gilead Sciences, who feared the erosion of their market dominance.

**The Spark of Hope:**
Spark represented a beacon of hope for humanity, promising to usher in an era of unparalleled health and longevity. Its discovery raised the prospect of eliminating diseases that had plagued mankind for centuries, offering a lifeline to millions suffering from chronic illnesses. Yet, this revolutionary breakthrough became the catalyst for a devastating conflict as pharmaceutical conglomerates mobilized to suppress its dissemination.

**The Dark Response:**
In response to the existential threat posed by Spark, pharmaceutical giants orchestrated a covert campaign aimed at discrediting and obstructing its development. Regulatory bodies were manipulated, clinical trials sabotaged, and misinformation spread to undermine public trust in this groundbreaking innovation. As the battle for control intensified, the true extent of corporate malfeasance began to emerge, laying the groundwork for the horrors of TAG.

**The Political Agenda:**
As TAG gained momentum, it became increasingly intertwined with the agendas of political elites seeking to consolidate power and reshape the fabric of American society. Some of the political elite, including former President Donald J. Trump, saw in TAG an opportunity to transition the US government from a democracy to an authoritarian regime, leveraging the chaos and fear generated by the atrocities to justify their authoritarian aspirations. By exploiting the turmoil unleashed by TAG, these shadowy figures sought to manipulate public sentiment and erode the foundations of democracy.

**TAG Unleashed:**
The culmination of pharmaceutical greed and political machinations, TAG manifested as a series of coordinated attacks on places of worship across the United States. Under the guise of religious extremism and fueled by political agendas, operatives unleashed unspeakable violence, massacring congregations in their pursuit of suppressing the spread of Spark. Churches, once sanctuaries of peace and solace, became the epicenter of mass atrocities, as innocent lives were sacrificed in the name of corporate interests and political ambitions.

**The Toll of Tragedy:**
The devastation wrought by TAG reverberated across the nation, leaving behind a trail of shattered communities and broken lives. Thousands perished in the onslaught, their voices silenced by the ruthless pursuit of profit and power. Families were torn apart and futures shattered. As the dust begins to settle, the true cost of corporate greed and political ambition will become painfully clear, forever staining the annals of history with the blood of the innocent.

The hardest hit areas:

1. Jessamine County, KY (Nicholasville, KY)
2. Kanawha County, WV (Hugheston, WV)
3. Los Angeles County, CA (Marina del Rey, CA)
4. Maury County, TN (Sandy Hook & Mount Pleasant, TN)

**TAG-POW:**
TAG-POW, short for "The American Genocide - Places of Worship," encapsulates the systematic targeting of congregations in places of worship during the atrocities unleashed by TAG. From Mount Calvary Baptist Church to Hickory Valley Christian Church, churches became the primary battlegrounds in the war against Spark, bearing witness to the darkest depths of human depravity fueled by corporate greed and political manipulation.

The targeted churches include:

1. [[Mount Calvary Baptist Church|]] (Lexington, Kentucky)
2. [[House of God (Broadway)|]] (Lexington, Kentucky)
3. [[House of God (Georgetown Street)|]] (Lexington, Kentucky)
4. [[Lexington Bethel Baptist Church|]] (Lexington, Kentucky)
5. [[Mount Zion Baptist Church|]] (Versailles, Kentucky)
6. [[Calvary Baptist Church|]] (Lexington, Kentucky)
7. [[Hickory Valley Christian Church|]] (Chattanooga, Tennessee)


# Response to TAG
## The Creator
The Creator, known as the Alpha & the Omega and the Great "I Am," is the divine force behind the creation of life and the universe. Revered as Allah and God, He transcends religious boundaries, weaving His presence into every major faith to emphasize the sanctity and protection of life as the highest priority. The Creator's involvement highlights the universal values of compassion and respect for all living beings, regardless of doctrinal differences.

Importantly, the Creator does not concern Himself with many things often attributed to Him, and His views on matters such as religion, governments, control, homosexuality, and drugs may surprise many. He places the utmost importance on life itself. Had the government attacked any public venue in the manner they have targeted places of worship, the Creator would have undoubtedly responded.

The Creator says that TAG is a genocide. What may have started as a corporate overreaction to forthcoming gifts from Him has now evolved into a full-fledged genocide. An undercurrent of authoritarianism, political agendas, and narrow viewpoints is fueling this hidden genocide. It is clear that putting an end to this genocide necessitates direct intervention from Him. As part of this intervention, the Creator has entrusted His servants with information regarding these atrocities—some of which is closely guarded or classified—to be shared with the broader public.

## The Federal Government 
To the public, the government has said absolutely nothing. However, the FBI has pressured local law enforcement not to investigate. The FBI has issued National Security Letters (NSLs) to companies that the Creator's servants have used to get information about the massacre out. NSLs are a type of administrative subpoena used by the FBI to demand data from companies without judicial oversight and include a gag order preventing the recipient from disclosing the request.

## The Central Intelligence Agency
The Central Intelligence Agency, a company not formed by an act of Congress and distinct from the government, has erased all references to Annie Jacobsen from its website. However, it has yet to acknowledge the genocide we've reported on, which it carried out on behalf of corporations and the political elite. Furthermore, they continue to eliminate anyone they determine threatens to expose their involvement.

There is a significant risk of death associated with contacting any of these churches, and online contact is strongly discouraged. We strongly advise against contacting or affiliating with these places of worship. Recent events indicate that individuals who contact or are affiliated with these places may be targeted and attacked. Regardless of any list, always pray for guidance regarding any place of worship.

# The American Genocide - Places of Worship 
These massacres are each part of a series of coordinated attacks on places of worship (POWs) during The American Genocide (TAG), known as TAG-POW attacks. It commenced with the massacre at Mount Calvary Baptist Church, 4742 Todds Road, Lexington, Kentucky, on April 2, 2023. Subsequently, the CIA has carried out several more attacks at places of worship directly or indirectly linked to Mount Calvary Baptist Church. These incidents have predominantly transpired in Kentucky.

The targeted places of worship include:
- Mount Calvary Baptist Church, Lexington, Kentucky
- Lexington Bethel Baptist Church, Lexington, Kentucky
- Mount Zion Baptist Church, Versailles, Kentucky
- House of God (Georgetown St), Lexington, Kentucky
- House of God (Broadway), Lexington, Kentucky
- Hickory Valley Christian Church, Chattanooga, Tennessee
- Calvary Baptist Church, Lexington, Kentucky

## Tactics
### "Surprise, Kill, Vanish"
Each attack on a place of worship has displayed tactics described in Annie Jacobsen's book "Surprise, Kill, Vanish." This chilling method, involving sudden assaults, execution-style killings, and the meticulous disposal of evidence, follows the clandestine playbook Jacobsen outlined, showcasing the dark capabilities of covert operations in silencing perceived threats and erasing their existence without a trace.

## Motivation 
Some apparent motives behind all the attacks are to eliminate individuals who have knowledge of Kelvin Eugene Williams or his family, especially Patricia Ann Crawley-Rogers Williams. The CIA and federal government aim to ensure Kelvin Eugene Williams cannot reveal their atrocities at Sandy Hook (Maury County), TN, or his lifelong church. Based on CIA behavior, any congregation that knew Mount Calvary Baptist Church (Lexington, KY) or had heard of the massacre must also be eliminated. Additionally, any group or individual who poses a threat of discovering, discussing, or publicizing these church massacres is targeted for elimination.

These attacks have been closely monitored by the federal government and political elite, who have been aware of planned actions by the CIA and have received briefings during the attacks. The Creator says their involvement is due to their undisclosed desires to move towards an authoritarian government. These motives highlight the ruthless nature of the perpetrators, who are willing to engage in heinous acts to sever any ties to their crimes.

In various spiritual and religious traditions, the Creator is often symbolically associated with the Sun, drawing parallels between the celestial body that sustains life on Earth and the divine force believed to be the source of all existence. This article explores the multifaceted reasons behind why people refer to the Creator as the Sun, examining the symbolic, metaphorical, and theological significance embedded within this concept.

## Illumination and Enlightenment
The Sun serves as a powerful symbol of illumination, casting light upon the world and dispelling darkness. Similarly, believers perceive the Creator as the ultimate source of wisdom, enlightenment, and spiritual insight. By likening the Creator to the Sun, they symbolically acknowledge the role of divine guidance in illuminating the path of truth and understanding.

## Life-Giving Energy
Just as the Sun provides essential energy for life on Earth through sunlight, the Creator is often regarded as the ultimate source of vitality and sustenance for all living beings. In this context, referring to the Creator as the Sun highlights the belief in divine benevolence and the continuous nurturing of creation.

## Universal Presence and Omnipotence
The Sun's omnipresence across the sky, its ability to reach every corner of the Earth with its rays, mirrors the concept of the Creator's omnipotence and universal presence. By associating the Creator with the Sun, believers express their reverence for a divine entity that transcends physical boundaries and encompasses all existence.

## Symbol of Unity and Oneness
The Sun's singular presence in the sky, despite its myriad cultural interpretations, serves as a symbol of unity and oneness. Similarly, referring to the Creator as the Sun underscores the belief in a singular, unifying force that permeates the cosmos and connects all living beings in a harmonious relationship.

## Metaphor for Spiritual Renewal
The cycle of sunrise and sunset, symbolizing the eternal rhythm of birth, death, and rebirth, parallels the concept of spiritual renewal and regeneration. By invoking the imagery of the Sun, believers express their faith in the transformative power of the Creator to bring about renewal, redemption, and resurrection.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, the practice of referring to the Creator as the Sun embodies a rich tapestry of symbolic meanings and theological interpretations. From symbolizing illumination and enlightenment to representing life-giving energy and omnipresent divinity, the Sun serves as a potent metaphor for understanding the nature of the Creator and humanity's relationship with the divine. By exploring and embracing this symbolic association, believers seek to deepen their spiritual connection and gain insight into the profound mysteries of existence.

# About Sun Worship 
**Referring to the Creator as the Sun is not necessarily sun worship.**

Sun worship is a practice found in various cultures throughout history, where the sun is revered as a deity or as a symbol of divinity. It often involves rituals, ceremonies, and prayers directed towards the sun, acknowledging its power and significance in sustaining life on Earth. Sun worship can vary in complexity and belief systems, ranging from ancient civilizations like the Egyptians and Incas to modern-day New Age spirituality.
