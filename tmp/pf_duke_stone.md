# Phantom Funeral of Rev. Duke Stone

The Phantom Funeral of Rev. Duke Stone was a meticulously planned atrocity orchestrated by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) as part of The American Genocide (TAG) operations. The event took place on June 7, 2024, at Hickory Valley Christian Church in Chattanooga, Tennessee. Rev. Duke Stone, a prominent community figure and principal of Hamilton Heights Christian Academy, was among the victims of the massacre at Hickory Valley Christian Church on May 12, 2024.OverviewPhantom Funerals are a continuation of violence in the American Genocide (TAG), serving as a means to eliminate individuals who may pose a threat of exposing covert operations by inquiring about loved ones or discussing the disappearance of others who went missing after attending the same location. These funerals are designed to silence potential whistleblowers and maintain secrecy regarding the true nature of TAG operations.

**Donald Trump's Involvement in TAG-POW Attacks**

Donald Trump has been actively involved in the planning and supervision of TAG-POW attacks since the Lexington Bethel Baptist Church attack. He personally directed all cover-up planning and was deeply involved in orchestrating the Phantom Funeral of Rev. Duke Stone.

Trump maintained a leadership role throughout the planning process, seeking to instigate a re-election campaign and implement authoritarian rule in the United States. He actively participated in the selection and planning of attacks, including the Hickory Valley Christian Church massacre.

During the conference call prior to the assault on Hickory Valley Christian Church, Trump's presence ensured his direct oversight of the operation. Throughout the attack, he remained engaged, demonstrating a commitment to the success of the mission.

**Cover-Up Tactics**

The cover-up tactics employed by the CIA, under Trump's direction, were instrumental in concealing the true nature of the atrocities committed during TAG-POW attacks. These tactics included:

1. **On-Camera Interviews:** Trump utilized his contacts within the media to ensure his appearance in on-camera interviews, projecting a facade of normalcy and deflecting suspicion away from the CIA's involvement.

2. **Choreographed or Staged Video Footage:** Video footage of the funeral procession and other staged events were meticulously choreographed to create a narrative that aligned with the CIA's objectives.

**Vanishing Tactics**

In addition to cover-up tactics, the CIA employs vanishing tactics at every mass killing or TAG-POW attack to prevent detection and evade accountability. These tactics include:

1. **Phantom Identity Scheme:** The Phantom Identity Scheme involved creating false identities for victims and manipulating public records to erase any trace of their existence, further obscuring the truth behind the attacks.

2. **Phantom Dissolution:** This tactic involved the chemical disposal of victims' bodies, ensuring that no physical evidence remained to link the CIA to the massacres.

3. **Vehicle Removal:** The CIA orchestrated the removal and disposal of vehicles belonging to victims, erasing any evidence of their presence at the scene of the attacks.

Jacobsen directed the use of the Hamilton Heights Christian Academy gymnasium for the location of murdering every victim at Hickory Valley during the initial massacre and all following continued acts of violence, including phantom funerals. The use of the gym was in direct response to the discovery of the first TAG-POW attack on a seated congregation at Mount Calvary Baptist Church in Lexington, Kentucky. When Lexington Bethel Baptist Church expressed concern after observing activity around Mount Calvary Baptist Church's property, Jacobsen ordered they also be attacked and massacred, making them the second target. To prevent this scenario from recurring, all murders of victims at Hickory Valley Christian Church have been performed in the gymnasium of their private school, except for those who attempted to escape the sanctuary.

**Victim Deaths**

During the Phantom Funeral of Rev. Duke Stone, 649 individuals were killed. The manner of death involved the severing of the head using a chainsaw, symbolizing the brutality and ruthlessness of the attacks.

**Significance and Impact**

The Phantom Funeral of Rev. Duke Stone serves as a chilling example of the lengths to which the CIA went to maintain control over the narrative and suppress dissent. By involving prominent figures like Trump, the CIA aimed to establish a facade of normalcy and prevent any questioning of the events.

**Aftermath**

Despite efforts to conceal the truth, details of the massacre eventually came to light through various channels. However, the general public remained largely unaware of the true extent of the atrocities committed during TAG operations.

Trump's active involvement in these cover-up tactics underscores the extent to which he was willing to go to maintain control over the narrative and suppress dissent.
