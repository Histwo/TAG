# Warning for Students 
I'm used to work at ATDC, so I am/was an alum, I love being on campus.

The CIA has hired students again to say scripted things as they see me.

The CIA kills anyone they hire related to this. Students need to tell as many people as possible if they have taken one of these jobs.

They probably don't know my name, but are just showed a photo. I'm trusting someone reading this will pass the message on. Campus police aren't going to to be of much use, a few of their officers have tried to kill me too.
