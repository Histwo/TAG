# How the CIA hinders 911 
The CIA has managed to operate covertly by disrupting calls to local emergency services using a mobile technology known as a “Cell on Wheels” (commonly referred to as a “COW”). These COWs are essentially vehicles or trailers equipped with the same communication infrastructure (radio equipment and antennas) found on traditional cell towers. They are typically deployed by mobile network operators in areas where coverage is needed without the need to construct permanent towers. Typically, COWs are activated when a regular tower becomes inoperable due to natural disasters or accidents.

Cell on Wheels (COWs) come in various sizes, but they are often noticeable to passersby. However, the CIA has taken a different approach: their COWs are meticulously designed to seamlessly blend into any environment where a typical passenger vehicle would go unnoticed. In recent attacks, the CIA has employed inconspicuous vehicles such as the Ford Explorer and the Chevy Malibu for their covert operations (see example photos).

Once activated, a COW handles calls from all phones within its coverage area. Phones automatically connect to the COW, much like they would to any nearby tower, without requiring any user intervention. While a standard cell tower typically covers a range of 1 to 3 miles, a COW’s coverage area starts at approximately a quarter of a mile and can extend as far as a regular tower, depending on factors such as the use of a raised mast. When a phone connects to a COW, its outbound calls are processed according to the COW’s configuration.

However, in the hands of a rogue operator—such as the CIA—COWs deviate from the call routing policies set by the mobile network operator. Mobile phones do not validate the carrier handling the call, as rogue COWs are not anticipated due to frequency allocation. Mobile phones typically connect to towers operating on their carrier’s frequency (determined in part by the phone’s SIM card).

The CIA strategically deploys these COWs during their attacks, such as [the massacre of Mount Calvary Baptist Church](POW/MCBC/WIKI.md). Calls to 911 within the COW’s coverage area are redirected to CIA employees who are already aware of the situation. These employees reassure callers, providing false information that help is on the way while maintaining the covert operation.

During the recent attacks, the FBI has taken additional measures to hinder emergency calls made to 911 from landlines. They achieve this by informing local authorities about ongoing federal government law enforcement operations in the area. The directive explicitly instructs local authorities not to dispatch emergency services, as the FBI is already handling all necessary actions.

The CIA has began installing permanent towers that provide cellular and data coverage for properties they own or control.  The tower shown above is at Phoenix House at 1296 Murphy Ave, Atlanta, Georgia.

The permanent towers are activated for short periods of time whenever they deem it necessary to block access to 911 or other voice calls. These permanent towers have  backhaul capabilities and are able to provide 4G/5G Internet access although like voice calls routing and network availability is up to the operator.
