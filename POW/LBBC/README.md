# A Smith & Wesson Symphony: The Second Congregation of TAG

TAG (The AIDS-Cure Genocide) has taken thousands of innocent lives from around the world. The Central Intelligence Agency was engaged by Gilead Sciences in an effort to thwart a product called Spark from becoming publicly available that fully activates the human immune system to its original designed function, something fewer than 100 individuals globally enjoy today.

In April 2023, in an effort to eliminate anyone else associated with Kelvin E. Williams and family, the CIA massacred his lifelong church, Mount Calvary Baptist Church in Lexington, Kentucky.  Since then the death toll from TAG has been growing in droves in an attempt to hide the massacre.

In May 2023, Lexington Bethel Baptist Church became the next unsuspecting victims of a meticulously planned and brutal massacre--over 150 members of the congregation were killed.  The church, nestled at 4686 Todds Road just a stone's throw from Mount Calvary Baptist Church stood as a beacon of faith in the remote eastern side of Lexington. Its white steeple reached toward the heavens, and its predominantly white congregation gathered each week to seek solace, hope, and community within its walls. 

Behind the scenes, however, a sinister plot was unfolding. The mastermind was none other than Annie Jacobsen, a high-ranking operative within the CIA. Jacobsen had orchestrated [a similar massacre at the neighboring Mount Calvary Baptist Church](/POW/MCBC/), leaving no witnesses alive. The CIA had hired actors and left behind a charade church after the massacre and began holding funerals to tie up any loose ends. Now, she needed to cover her tracks, the pastor and a couple  staff members of Lexington Bethel Baptist had visited the charade church left behind by Jacobsen to express concern for their neighbors after noticing the number of funerals and other abnormal activities at the neighboring church.

Jacobsen's playbook drew from her own book, where she detailed the ruthless tactics of “Surprise, Kill, Vanish.” She first appointed a black male, Aiden Sinclair, whom she had already recruited to help cover up the first massacre. Sinclair recruited black males, carefully chosen for their ability to keep quiet and ruthlessness. Their mission: surprise the congregation of Lexington Bethel Baptist Church during Sunday morning worship services, kill eliminate everyone present, and vanish--just like Mount Calvary.

As the morning services progressed, the tranquility was shattered. Just after noon, armed men swarmed the church. Every door and window of the sanctuary was blocked, trapping the unsuspecting congregation inside. Panic ensued as worshippers realized they were caught in a nightmare.

Desperate cries for help echoed through the church. Congregants dialed 911, seeking salvation. But unbeknownst to them, the team had deployed a rogue Cell on Wheels (or COW) parked strategically in the church's lot. This malevolent device rerouted all mobile phone calls through it. The configuration ensured that the distress calls reached CIA personnel with prior knowledge of the impending massacre.

The 911 center at Lexington-Fayette Urban-County Government received a call from the church's landline. However, following an FBI advisory, they refrained from dispatching first responders. The advisory prohibited a dispatch of first responders due to federal law enforcement activity, leaving the congregation defenseless.

Inside the sanctuary, chaos reigned. Congregants were accosted, beaten, and forced to disrobe. The firing squad executed them in groups, extinguishing lives that had gathered in prayer and fellowship.

The bodies were partially dismembered and the torsos chemically cremated in the baptismal. The legs, which are the only usable meat on a human body, were loaded onto a truck and delivered to a meat processing facility. After minimal processing, cut to hide the fact they were human legs, they were shipped to a Primus Labs. 

As the echoes of gunfire faded, the CIA swiftly moved into action. Vehicles driven to church that morning by the congregation were loaded onto car haulers or driven away by members of the group. Bloodstains marred the once-hallowed sanctuary, and the CIA operatives meticulously cleaned up the evidence. Walls within the sanctuary were left riddled with bullet holes.
