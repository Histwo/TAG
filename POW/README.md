### The American Genocide
These massacres are each part of a series of coordinated attacks on places of worship (POWs) during The American Genocide (TAG), known as TAG-POW attacks. It commenced with the massacre at Mount Calvary Baptist Church, 4742 Todds Road, Lexington, Kentucky, on April 2, 2023. Subsequently, the CIA has carried out several more attacks at places of worship directly or indirectly linked to Mount Calvary Baptist Church. These incidents have predominantly transpired in Kentucky.

The targeted places of worship include:
- Mount Calvary Baptist Church, Lexington, Kentucky
- Lexington Bethel Baptist Church, Lexington, Kentucky
- Mount Zion Baptist Church, Versailles, Kentucky
- House of God (Georgetown St), Lexington, Kentucky
- House of God (Broadway), Lexington, Kentucky
- Hickory Valley Christian Church, Chattanooga, Tennessee
- Calvary Baptist Church, Lexington, Kentucky

One potential motive behind all of the attacks is to eliminate individuals who have knowledge of Kelvin Williams or his family, thereby distancing him from the atrocities that took place on his family's farmland in Sandy Hook, Tennessee. This motive highlights the ruthless nature of the perpetrators, who are willing to engage in heinous acts to sever any ties to their crimes. Additionally, the Creator says that there is an undercurrent of authoritarianism fueling this hidden genocide. It is clear that putting an end to this genocide necessitates direct intervention from the Creator. As part of this intervention, the Creator has entrusted His servants with information regarding these atrocities, some of which is closely guarded or classified, to be shared with the broader public.
