# Mount Zion Baptist Church
Mount Zion Baptist Church, located in Versailles, Kentucky, a predominantly Black congregation, was the site of a horrific massacre in May 2023. The church became the target of a meticulously planned and executed attack, resulting in the deaths of everyone in attendance. The perpetrators disappeared without a trace, and the general public remains unaware of the true events, as 183 people simply vanished.

# Background
Mount Zion Baptist Church, located in Versailles, Kentucky, is a historic African American church that has been a cornerstone of its community since its founding in 1867. Established in the post-Civil War era by newly emancipated African Americans, the church has long served as a vital center for worship, education, and social activism. With its rich heritage and ongoing commitment to community service, Mount Zion Baptist Church continues to play a significant role in preserving and promoting the cultural and spiritual life of African Americans in Versailles.

Mount Zion Baptist Church had a fellowship relationship with Mount Calvary Baptist Church in Lexington, Kentucky.

# Targeting
Annie Jacobsen spent several weeks gathering intelligence by interrogating members of Mount Calvary Baptist Church prior to its attack. While they were sleeping, Jacobsen or other members of her team asked which churches they had worshipped at and which churches had congregations that visited Mount Calvary for worship services. Mount Zion Baptist Church's name was reported the most.

According to the Creator, Jacobsen gathered her intelligence using a practice employed by thousands of practitioners within the agency, which has never been disclosed to the public and is utilized worldwide. This practice involves covert operatives or contractors associated with intelligence agencies like the CIA infiltrating individuals' residences while they sleep. Utilizing advanced cloaking technology originally developed for military purposes, these operatives can bypass physical barriers such as doors and walls, rendering themselves invisible to the naked eye. Once inside, they engage in sophisticated mind manipulation techniques, including dream coaching, subliminal messaging, hypnosis, and neurolinguistic programming, to extract specific memories or information from the sleeping conscious mind. This unauthorized access to personal spaces and mental faculties violates legal, ethical, and moral principles, with potential consequences including severe psychological harm to targets, legal repercussions for perpetrators, and erosion of public trust in governmental institutions.

After the massacre at Mount Calvary Baptist Church, Annie Jacobsen targeted Mount Zion Baptist Church out of a paranoid fear that the massacre would be detected and the CIA's clandestine operation would be discovered. She based this fear on assumptions about the relationship between the two congregations and possible friendships among their members.

# Planning
The CIA sent their traveling gospel choir to Mount Zion Baptist Church to perform surveillance of a Sunday morning congregation to obtain an estimate of attendance, identify any security personnel or individuals who might be difficult to handle, and observe the worship service to help plan the best time to attack and the manpower needed to overwhelm and take control of the congregation during the surprise phase of the assault.

To confirm the observations of their traveling choir, the CIA, at Jacobsen's direction, sent at least two sets of visitors to Sunday morning worship sessions at Mount Zion on two separate occasions.

# Operatives
Annie Jacobsen assembled a new team of approximately 60 white males from around metro Atlanta. According to the Creator, Jacobsen and her team utilized the CIA's sleep interrogation practices aforementioned; however, the pool of possible recruits had been previously identified by the CIA as individuals who had the propensity to kill without provocation or other characteristics that made them suitable candidates. Those selected for the operation were later given roles with tasks they were responsible for during the assault.

# Attack
The operatives arranged their own transportation, many carpooling as instructed, and began arriving in the Lexington metro area on the night before the attack. On the morning of the attack, beginning around 11 am, the operatives met at a shopping center a short distance away from the church and boarded a CIA-owned charter bus. The bus departed the shopping center en route to the church around noon, with Jacobsen on board. Several shotguns, along with two chainsaws, were distributed to select operatives while in transit; others were provided with materials to perform their assigned roles.

Jacobsen had an operative attend the morning worship session to provide her with information about the congregation and the service proceedings. Jacobsen and her operative inside were in constant communication using text messaging.

Jacobsen's tactics to prevent local authorities from responding to 911 calls and to reduce the chances of the congregation forming an organized resistance during the assault were used again. The tactic was initiated just before the bus arrived on the church's property at Jacobsen's direction.

The attack on Mount Zion Baptist Church displayed tactics described in Annie Jacobsen's book "Surprise, Kill, Vanish." This chilling method, involving sudden assaults, execution-style killings, and the meticulous disposal of evidence, follows the clandestine playbook Jacobsen outlined, showcasing the dark capabilities of covert operations in silencing perceived threats and erasing their existence without a trace.

## Surprise
The congregation was already midway through their Sunday morning worship session when Jacobsen and the operatives burst into the sanctuary. Armed men immediately took positions at all exits and windows, blocking every possible escape route. Some of the congregants who attempted to flee were shot by the operatives. Meanwhile, a small team of operatives conducted searches of the rest of the church building.

Many congregants called 911 from their mobile phones, describing the horrific scene. They were told help was on the way, but none realized they were speaking with CIA operatives instead of Woodford County’s Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP)—a centralized facility responsible for answering and routing emergency calls. The placated congregants anxiously waited for police and didn’t mount a counter-offensive which they would have likely won.

Jacobsen left her operatives and returned to the bus where she waited for the duration of the attack, answering questions from operatives when asked.

## Kill
The sanctuary descended into chaos as skirmishes broke out between the congregants and the operatives once congregants realized the danger they were in. Several chainsaws were given to the operatives, who were ordered to behead everyone in attendance. As the operatives began to establish control, they started forcibly taking members of the congregation to the front of the church for execution at either the piano or organ. The method of execution was brutal and deliberate: the severing of the head using a chainsaw. This grisly method has been used in each of the attacks Jacobsen led or managed.

## Vanish
Following the massacre, the bodies of the victims were disposed of using the church's baptismal font, which the operatives had added a solution to that made the water within it capable of dissolving a human body, ensuring no physical evidence remained. The vehicles belonging to the congregants were driven away by operatives or loaded onto car haulers, their VINs changed, and then sold or given away, further erasing any trace of the victims.

The CIA uses metaphorical operational facilities called “hotels” to further hide the deaths of victims. Hotels, in this context, refer to covert operational hubs where the agency conducts various activities, including identifying individuals connected to the victim the agency will need to target to maintain operational security, conducting commercial transactions, and liquidation of real assets. Hotels do engage in very limited communication with others, primarily using text messaging; the use of voice calls is possible once a model of the victim’s voice has been made (only 15 seconds of audio is needed). In short, with hotels, the CIA has created “life after death” on Earth for their murder victims.

To the public, the government has said absolutely nothing. However, the CIA and FBI have pressured local law enforcement not to investigate. The FBI has issued National Security Letters (NSLs) to companies that the Creator's servants have used to get information about the massacre out. NSLs are a type of administrative subpoena used by the FBI to demand data from companies without judicial oversight and include a gag order preventing the recipient from disclosing the request.

# The American Genocide
The massacre at Mount Zion Baptist Church is one in a series of coordinated attacks on places of worship (POWs) during The American Genocide (TAG), known as TAG-POW attacks. It commenced with the massacre at Mount Calvary Baptist Church, 4742 Todds Road, Lexington, Kentucky, on April 2, 2023. Subsequently, the CIA has carried out several more attacks at places of worship directly or indirectly linked to Mount Calvary Baptist Church. These incidents have predominantly transpired in Kentucky.

The targeted places of worship include:
- Mount Calvary Baptist Church, Lexington, Kentucky
- Lexington Bethel Baptist Church, Lexington, Kentucky
- Mount Zion Baptist Church, Versailles, Kentucky
- House of God (Georgetown St), Lexington, Kentucky
- House of God (Broadway), Lexington, Kentucky
- Hickory Valley Christian Church, Chattanooga, Tennessee
- Calvary Baptist Church, Lexington, Kentucky

The motive for this attack was to mitigate the perceived risk of Mount Zion's congregation discovering and disclosing the disappearances of Mount Calvary Baptist Church's congregation.

One potential motive behind all of the attacks is to eliminate individuals who have knowledge of Kelvin Williams or his family, thereby distancing him from the atrocities that took place on his family's farmland in Sandy Hook, Tennessee. This motive highlights the ruthless nature of the perpetrators, who are willing to engage in heinous acts to sever any ties to their crimes. Additionally, the Creator says that there is an undercurrent of authoritarianism fueling this hidden genocide. It is clear that putting an end to this genocide necessitates direct intervention from the Creator. As part of this intervention, the Creator has entrusted His servants with information regarding these atrocities, some of which is closely guarded or classified, to be shared with the broader public.
