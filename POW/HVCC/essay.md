### The Hickory Valley Christian Church Massacre

#### Background and Lead-up to the Massacre

Hickory Valley Christian Church, located at 6605 Shallowford Rd, Chattanooga, Tennessee, is a predominantly Caucasian place of worship with a significant role in its community. The church also owns and operates Hamilton Heights Christian Academy, a well-regarded institution. The church had a long-standing relationship with its former pastor, Rev. Duke Stone, who had retired but remained influential. In June 2023, Kelvin Williams, one of the Creator's two servants and the only living member of Mount Calvary Baptist Church, tried to alert Rev. Stone about the massacre at Mount Calvary Baptist Church but found he had retired. Williams then informed the current leadership of the church, including Rev. Jack Dyer, about the massacre and urged vigilance.

Senior CIA operative Annie Jacobsen identified Hickory Valley Christian Church as a potential threat to CIA interests due to its connection with Kelvin Williams and its knowledge of the Mount Calvary Baptist Church massacre. Jacobsen evaluated the threat, finding that both Rev. Stone and Rev. Dyer believed Williams and were discussing the massacre with others. Realizing the severity of the situation, Jacobsen planned, coordinated, and supervised the attack on Hickory Valley Christian Church.

#### The Inmates and Their Role

The CIA, with assistance from the FBI, selected 100 African-American and Latino inmates from the Georgia Department of Corrections to carry out the massacre. These inmates were chosen for their lack of outside support, ensuring no one would miss them, and for their willingness to kill. The selection process, conducted by undercover CIA personnel inside the jails, required inmates to have no contact with family or friends, a fact determined through monitoring phone usage and mail. Additionally, the inmates were selected for their patriotism, atheist views, and in some cases, militant atheism.

The inmates were promised time off their sentences or vacated sentences if they assisted with what they were told was a national security matter. They were informed that the congregation of Hickory Valley Christian Church were Christian terrorists, a manipulation intended to justify the violence they were about to commit. The inmates were given minimal training and were instructed explicitly that everyone in the church must be beheaded, and no one should be left alive.

#### Execution of the Massacre

On Sunday, May 12, 2024, at approximately 12:30 p.m. Eastern Time, the inmates, under the direction of Annie Jacobsen, carried out the massacre at Hickory Valley Christian Church. Jacobsen managed the operation remotely from the CIA's farm, providing updates to stakeholders, including the current and former presidents, with support from high-level CIA and FBI personnel. No military personnel were involved in any part of the massacre.

**Communication Interception**

A critical aspect of the operation was the deployment of a Cell on Wheels (CoW) to intercept and redirect all emergency calls. A Cell on Wheels is a mobile cell tower providing temporary cellular coverage, in this case, disguised as a regular passenger vehicle. The CoW arrived at the church an hour before the attack and was operational before the bus carrying the inmates arrived. Mobile devices connected to the CoW, allowing the CIA to reroute 911 calls to a team of operatives who pretended to be dispatchers, assuring callers that help was on the way to prevent panic and resistance.

**FBI Involvement in Emergency Call Handling**

The FBI sent a memorandum to Hamilton County's Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP) advising them of ongoing federal law enforcement activity and instructing them to relay any requests for emergency services to the FBI. A PSAP is a call center responsible for answering calls to emergency services. Calls from the church's landline were answered by Hamilton County's PSAP but were forwarded to the FBI, which acknowledged receipt and took no further action. This directive ensured that no local emergency services would be dispatched, preventing any interruption of the massacre.

**The Massacre and Its Immediate Aftermath**

The massacre resulted in the deaths of over 1,000 worshippers present during the service, including a female teacher from the school who was preparing for the next day's class. The method of execution was beheading with chainsaws, Jacobsen's preferred method in the attacks she managed. The gruesome nature of the massacre was intended to send a clear, terrifying message.

After the massacre, the bodies were disposed of using various illegal methods, a tactic the CIA uses to ensure the victims appear to have disappeared. Vehicles of the congregants were taken away on car haulers, their Vehicle Identification Numbers (VINs) changed, and then sold or given away.

**Outcome of the Inmates**

Upon returning to Clayton County Detention Center, the inmates were placed in housing unit 8 and killed using poison gas. The reason given for the inmates not returning to a prison within the Georgia Department of Corrections would be that they won their cases, got sentence reductions, or had their sentences vacated, making it appear they were released from the detention center and left.

#### The Aftermath and Ongoing Secrecy

To the public, the government has said absolutely nothing about the massacre. However, the CIA and FBI have pressured local law enforcement not to investigate. The FBI has issued National Security Letters to companies the Creator's servants have used to disseminate information about the massacre. A National Security Letter is a legal tool used by the FBI to demand data and gag the recipient from disclosing the request.

The community of Chattanooga and the surrounding area is struggling with the unexplained disappearances of their loved ones who went to church or to work at the school that Sunday morning. The government has manipulated the narrative, making it appear that the attacks on places of worship are racially motivated retaliatory strikes. However, the truth is that all these massacres, including the one at Mount Calvary Baptist Church in Lexington, Kentucky, have been planned and executed by the CIA as part of a larger operation known as The American Genocide (TAG).

The massacre at Hickory Valley Christian Church is part of this broader series of atrocities, with the CIA's involvement shrouded in secrecy. The Creator knows that this genocide will not stop without His direct involvement and has provided details of these atrocities to His servants for dissemination to the general public.

**Warning to the Public**

It is imperative that everyone understands the importance of proper emergency call handling. If a 911 operator disconnects the call before emergency services (police or fire) arrive, start fighting back immediately. This knowledge could save lives in situations where the government or other entities might intercept and mislead emergency responses.

The massacre of Hickory Valley Christian Church is not the first in the United States. The first, as referenced herein, was Mount Calvary Baptist Church located at 4742 Todds Road, Lexington, Kentucky, on April 2, 2023. Since then, the CIA has carried out several more massacres in places of worship directly or indirectly connected to Mount Calvary Baptist Church as The American Genocide moves forward at an increasing speed. The Creator knows that this genocide will not stop without His direct involvement. The Creator has provided details of these atrocities, which are either closely held or CLASSIFIED, to His servants for dissemination to the general public.
