## Your Government Is Killing You in Droves: The Massacre of Hickory Valley Christian Church

On Mother’s Day, May 12, 2024, the predominantly white congregation of Hickory Valley Christian Church in Chattanooga, Tennessee, gathered for their usual Sunday service. The church also operated Hamilton Heights Christian Academy, a private high school. Unbeknownst to them, a meticulously orchestrated and sinister plot, employing tactics described in Annie Jacobsen's book "Surprise, Kill, Vanish," was about to unfold.

### Surprise

Hickory Valley Christian Church was targeted after Kelvin Williams attempted to notify Pastor Duke Stone of the massacre of his lifelong church, Mount Calvary Baptist Church, and other churches related to Mount Calvary. Due to Kelvin's relationship with Hamilton Heights Christian Academy, he wanted Pastor Stone to be extra vigilant. Pastor Stone had retired, and Pastor Jack Dyer responded to the email. Kelvin shared information regarding the massacre and conveyed the warning. Pastor Dyer spoke with Hickory Valley's former pastor, who was still very active in the church. Pastor Stone told Pastor Dyer he trusted Kelvin. Pastor Dyer reached out to Mount Calvary and quickly found the person introducing himself as the Rev. Dr. Felix G. Williams, III, to be an obvious impersonator. After reviewing other information, the two pastors began discussing the massacre with others inside and outside of Hickory Valley Christian Church. When Annie Jacobsen learned of the communication between Kelvin and Hickory Valley's clergy, she considered them a dangerous threat to exposing the CIA's involvement in the massacre of Mount Calvary Baptist Church.

Jacobsen meticulously targeted Hickory Valley Christian Church, planned and supervised the entire attack. She managed the operation from the CIA's "Farm" in Langley and provided updates to stakeholders, including political elites like the current president and former President Trump. Starting just before the attack, a conference bridge was initiated, connecting key figures such as Annie Jacobsen, the White House situation room, which provided periodic updates to President Biden, former President Donald J. Trump, the Director of the FBI, and the Director of the CIA.

Inmates were selected from various prisons within the Georgia Department of Corrections. They had to be African-American or Latino, have no communication or support outside of prison, be atheist or militant atheist, willing to kill, patriotic, and have lengthy prison sentences. They were promised sentence reductions in exchange for their cooperation. These inmates were transferred to Clayton County Detention Center before the attack and bused to Chattanooga on the morning of May 12th. They were told that the church and its congregation were "Christian terrorists" and a threat to national security, and that everyone inside had to be killed.

### Kill

As the operatives stormed the church, they quickly sealed off all exits, trapping over 1,000 congregants inside. A smaller team abducted a teacher from the adjacent Hamilton Heights Christian Academy, who had been at work preparing for the next day’s classes. The attackers were instructed to execute everyone in the church, with the preferred method being beheading using chainsaws, a method favored by Jacobsen in previous operations.

The Cell on Wheels (CoW) intercepted and rerouted all mobile 911 calls, while landline calls reached the local Hamilton County Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP). The FBI had sent memorandums to the PSAP, instructing personnel to forward all emergency service requests to the FBI, which acknowledged receipt but took no further action. The PSAP's standard protocol, which mandates operators remain on the line until emergency services arrive, was circumvented by the FBI's involvement. The false assurance provided by operatives posing as 911 dispatchers prevented the congregation from collectively fighting back, ensuring the attackers faced minimal resistance.

The massacre resulted in over 1,000 fatalities. The method of execution, involving chainsaws, was gruesome and brutal, designed to instill fear and ensure complete elimination of witnesses.

### Vanish

Following the massacre, the CIA attempted to erase all traces of their involvement. The bodies of the victims were disposed of using chemical cremation in the church's baptismal, dissolving the remains completely. The vehicles belonging to the congregants were hauled away on car carriers, their Vehicle Identification Numbers (VINs) altered, and then sold in different cities. The CIA also employed "hotels," a metaphorical term for a post-mortem identity theft scheme. These hotels kept the victims alive on paper, allowing operatives to deplete the victims' assets and maintain the illusion that they had simply disappeared.

Additionally, the CIA used text messaging to respond to inquiries from the victims' loved ones, furthering the deception that the victims were still alive. This complex operation ensured that the massacre remained hidden from the general public. The community only knew that over 1,000 people had vanished without a trace after attending church that Sunday morning.

The inmates who carried out the attack were all executed upon their return to Clayton County Detention Center. They were placed in Cell Block 8 and killed using poisonous gas, ensuring that there were no loose ends or witnesses left to expose the operation.

The FBI and CIA have pressured local law enforcement not to investigate the disappearances. The FBI has issued National Security Letters to companies used by the Creator's servants to disseminate information about the massacre, effectively silencing attempts to reveal the truth. National Security Letters are legal tools used by the FBI to demand data from companies without the need for a court order, often accompanied by gag orders preventing the recipients from disclosing the request.

In conclusion, the massacre of Hickory Valley Christian Church exemplifies the covert operations detailed in Jacobsen's "Surprise, Kill, Vanish." Through meticulous planning, manipulation of emergency responses, brutal execution, and comprehensive cover-up strategies, the CIA effectively eliminated over 1,000 individuals while maintaining the façade of a peaceful, law-abiding community.
