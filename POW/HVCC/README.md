### Hickory Valley Christian Church Massacre

**Location:** Hickory Valley Christian Church, 6605 Shallowford Rd, Chattanooga, Tennessee, USA  
**Date:** May 12, 2024  
**Fatalities:** 1000+
**Perpetrators:** The Central Intelligence Agency

#### Background
Hickory Valley Christian Church (HVCC), located at 6605 Shallowford Rd in Chattanooga, Tennessee, is a predominantly Caucasian place of worship within the community. HVCC also owns and operates Hamilton Heights Christian Academy (HHCA). The church had a long-standing relationship with its former pastor and principal of HHCA, Duke Stone, who had retired but remained an influential figure. In June 2023, Kelvin Williams tried alerting Duke Stone about the massacre at Mount Calvary Baptist Church (MCBC) but found that Stone had retired. Williams then informed the current leadership of the church about the MCBC massacre and shared all the information he had at the time, urging them to be extra vigilant.

#### Incident
Senior CIA operative Annie Jacobsen identified Hickory Valley Christian Church (HVCC) as a potential threat to CIA interests due to its connection with Kelvin Williams and its knowledge of the MCBC massacre. Jacobsen planned, coordinated, and supervised the attack and massacre. 

On Sunday, May 12, 2024, at approximately 12:30 p.m. Eastern Time, Jacobsen led a team of about 100 males of African-American or Latino heritage to infiltrate the sanctuary during the morning worship services. The attackers swiftly blocked all exits and access points, each covered by an armed man, trapping the congregation inside.

##### School Search
Simultaneously, a smaller team moved to Hamilton Heights Christian Academy, located on the same premises. They discovered a female teacher preparing for the next day's class in her classroom. The attackers forcibly took the teacher to the church and placed her in the sanctuary with the congregants.

##### Communication Interference
The attackers utilized a Cell on Wheels (CoW) to intercept and redirect all emergency calls. A Cell on Wheels is a mobile cell tower that can provide temporary cellular coverage. In this case, the CoW was disguised as a regular passenger vehicle, allowing it to blend in seamlessly with other cars in the church's parking lot. The CoW arrived at least an hour before the attack and parked in the church's parking lot. The CoW's operator powered up the radio equipment about fifteen minutes before the bus carrying the attackers arrived. 

The CoW operates like a regular cell tower; when its radio equipment is powered up, mobile devices in the vicinity connect to it automatically, as they do with any cell tower they encounter. Calls made after a mobile device connects to a CoW are handled according to the CoW's configuration. In this case, the attackers rerouted 911 calls to a team of CIA personnel who had prior knowledge of the attack. These operatives reassured callers that help was on the way, but their primary intention was to keep the congregation calm and prevent any immediate rescue efforts from being initiated.

#### Casualties
The massacre resulted in the deaths of over 1000 worshippers who were present during the service, including the female teacher from the school. Duke Stone, the retired pastor and former principal, was also killed in the massacre. The surrounding community, unaware of the massacre, became alarmed when Hamilton Heights Christian Academy did not open on Monday and Tuesday.

#### Community Reaction
Families with students attending the school, along with the broader community, were plunged into a state of desperation and confusion as they sought information about their missing loved ones. Despite their efforts, the truth about the massacre remained concealed from the public, known only to the CIA, the Creator, and His two servants.

#### Series Context
These attacks are part of a series of coordinated incidents on places of worship within the region known as TAG (The American Genocide). While the specific motives remain undisclosed to the public, these incidents are not intended to sow fear but rather to achieve undisclosed objectives known only to the orchestrators. The attacks on places of worship have occurred primarily in Kentucky; this is the first one outside of Kentucky.

#### Aftermath
People all around the Tennessee Valley and Chattanooga continue to grapple with the unexplained disappearances of their friends and family members. Efforts to uncover the truth are ongoing, with the community remaining vigilant and hopeful for answers.
