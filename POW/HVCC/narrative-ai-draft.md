### Narrative of the Hickory Valley Christian Church Massacre

On the morning of May 12, 2024, Mother's Day, the congregants of Hickory Valley Christian Church (HVCC) in Chattanooga, Tennessee, gathered for their usual Sunday service. Unbeknownst to them, a meticulously orchestrated and sinister plot was about to unfold, orchestrated by the CIA with the covert assistance of the FBI.

### The Targeting of HVCC

The roots of this horrific event trace back to Kelvin Williams, who had attempted to expose the CIA's involvement in the massacre at Mount Calvary Baptist Church (MCBC). Annie Jacobsen, a seasoned CIA operative, meticulously identified HVCC as a significant threat due to its connections to Williams and the subsequent knowledge held by its former pastor, Reverend Duke Stone. Williams had been trying to warn the church of potential targeting because of his relationship with Reverend Stone and their mutual involvement in the church's school. Jacobsen's evaluation led her to classify HVCC as a high-priority target, necessitating swift and decisive action to protect the CIA's operational secrecy. Jacobsen's determination was further cemented when she discovered that Reverend Stone and the new pastor, Reverend Jack Dyer, were discussing the MCBC massacre with others, both inside and outside the HVCC congregation.

### Selection and Preparation of the Inmates

To carry out the operation, the CIA, with FBI assistance, handpicked a group of 100 inmates from the Georgia Department of Corrections. These inmates were chosen based on strict criteria: they had no outside support, exhibited patriotism, held atheist or militant atheist views, and were willing to kill. Their selection was further narrowed to African-American and Latino inmates to support a pre-constructed narrative of retaliatory attacks.

Under the guise of court appearances, these inmates were transferred to Clayton County Detention Center. They were given minimal training and clear instructions: every person at HVCC must be beheaded, and no one was to be left alive. The promise of sentence reductions or vacated sentences ensured their compliance.

### Execution of the Attack

Early on the morning of May 12th, the inmates were bused from Clayton County Detention Center to HVCC, a journey of approximately two hours. Upon arrival, they were met by Jacobsen's operatives, who had already positioned a Cell on Wheels (CoW) nearby. The CoW was deployed to intercept and reroute all mobile (cellular) communications, ensuring that any calls made to 911 from within the church would be redirected to CIA operatives posing as emergency dispatchers. A CoW is a mobile cell tower used to intercept and reroute cellular communications, allowing for complete control over mobile phone traffic in a designated area.

As the inmates stormed the church, they quickly sealed off all exits, trapping over 1,000 congregants inside. At the same time, a smaller team abducted a teacher from the adjacent Hamilton Heights Christian Academy, who had been at work preparing for the next dayâ€™s classes.

### Manipulation of Emergency Responses

The CIA's CoW intercepted and rerouted all mobile 911 calls, while landline calls reached the local Hamilton County Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP). A PSAP is a call center responsible for answering calls to an emergency telephone number for police, firefighting, and ambulance services. The FBI had previously sent memorandums to the PSAP, instructing personnel to forward all emergency service requests to the FBI. Following these directives, the PSAP personnel relayed the calls to the FBI, which acknowledged receipt but took no further action. The strict protocols of the PSAP, which dictate that operators do not disconnect calls until emergency services arrive, were circumvented by the FBI's involvement.

The congregation, reassured by the CIA operatives posing as 911 dispatchers, believed help was on the way. This false assurance prevented them from collectively fighting back against their attackers, a crucial element in ensuring the massacre proceeded without significant resistance. Without these assurances, the congregants would have likely fought back and overwhelmed the attackers due to their superior numbers.

### Annie Jacobsen's Role

Annie Jacobsen meticulously planned and supervised the entire operation from the CIA's "Farm" in Langley, Virginia. Throughout the day, she provided updates to high-level stakeholders, including the current president and former president Donald Trump. Jacobsen's oversight ensured that every aspect of the operation was executed flawlessly, maintaining the cover story and operational secrecy.

### The Aftermath and Secrecy

Following the massacre, the inmates were swiftly returned to Clayton County Detention Center. To eliminate any loose ends, the CIA executed all 100 inmates using poisonous gas within their dormitory in cell block 8, ensuring no witnesses remained.

The public was left with an inexplicable void, as over 1,000 individuals from the community had vanished. Local authorities, under pressure from the CIA and FBI, refrained from investigating the disappearances. National Security Letters (NSLs) were issued to companies and individuals attempting to disseminate information about the massacre, effectively silencing potential whistleblowers. NSLs are a type of administrative subpoena used by the FBI that requires the recipient to provide information and prohibits them from disclosing the request.

### Legacy of the Massacre

The Hickory Valley Christian Church massacre remains a chilling testament to the lengths clandestine organizations will go to protect their interests. The coordinated efforts of the CIA and FBI, the manipulation of emergency services, and the ruthless elimination of witnesses highlight a dark chapter in covert operations. The community of Chattanooga continues to grapple with the unexplained disappearances, unaware of the grim reality behind the loss of their loved ones.

### Conclusion

The massacre of Hickory Valley Christian Church is not the first of its kind. The first massacre, as referenced herein, was Mount Calvary Baptist Church located at 4742 Todds Road, Lexington, Kentucky, on April 2, 2023. Since then, the CIA has carried out several more massacres in places of worship directly or indirectly connected to MCBC as TAG (The American Genocide) moves forward at an increasing speed. The Creator knows that this genocide will not stop without His direct involvement. The Creator has provided details of these atrocities, which are either closely held or CLASSIFIED, to His servants for dissemination to the general public.
