On Mother’s Day, May 12, 2024, the predominantly white congregation of Hickory Valley Christian Church in Chattanooga, Tennessee, gathered for their usual Sunday service. The church also operated Hamilton Heights Christian Academy, a private high school. Unbeknownst to them, a meticulously orchestrated and sinister plot was about to unfold.

### Targeting Hickory Valley Christian Church

Hickory Valley Christian Church was targeted after Kelvin Williams attempted to notify Reverend Duke Stone, the retired pastor of Hickory Valley Christian Church, about the massacre of his lifelong church, Mount Calvary Baptist Church, and other churches related to Mount Calvary. Due to Kelvin's relationship with Hamilton Heights Christian Academy, he wanted Reverend Stone to be extra vigilant. Since Reverend Stone had retired, the current pastor, Reverend Jack Dyer, responded to Kelvin's email. Kelvin shared detailed information regarding the massacre and conveyed a warning to be cautious.

Reverend Dyer discussed the email with Reverend Stone, who was still very active in the church. Reverend Stone affirmed his trust in Kelvin. To verify the claims, Reverend Dyer reached out to Mount Calvary and quickly found the person introducing himself as the Rev. Dr. Felix G. Williams, III, to be an obvious impersonator. After reviewing additional information, the two pastors began discussing the massacre with others both inside and outside of Hickory Valley Christian Church.

When Annie Jacobsen, a high-ranking CIA operative, learned of the communication between Kelvin Williams and Hickory Valley's clergy, she considered them a dangerous threat to exposing the CIA's involvement in the massacre of Mount Calvary Baptist Church. This assessment led Jacobsen to target Hickory Valley Christian Church for an imminent attack to protect the secrecy of their operations.

### Selection and Preparation of the Operatives

To carry out the operation, a group of 100 inmates were selected from various prisons within the Georgia Department of Corrections. The selection criteria were stringent: the inmates had to be African-American or Latino, have no communication or support outside of prison, be atheist or militant atheist, be willing to kill, and be patriotic. They also needed to have lengthy prison sentences and be willing to help with a national security matter while keeping their cooperation secret. These inmates were transferred to Clayton County Detention Center prior to the attack, and on the morning of the attack, they were bused to Chattanooga.

The inmates were given minimal training and clear instructions: to ensure no one at Hickory Valley Christian Church was left alive. They were told that the church and congregation were "Christian Terrorists" and a threat to national security. The promise of sentence reductions ensured their cooperation and compliance.

### Execution of the Attack

Early on the morning of May 12th, the operatives were transported to Hickory Valley Christian Church, a journey of approximately two hours. Upon arrival, they were met by other operatives who had already positioned a Cell on Wheels (CoW) nearby. A CoW is a mobile cell tower used to intercept and reroute cellular communications, allowing for complete control over mobile phone traffic in a designated area.

As the operatives stormed the church, they quickly sealed off all exits, trapping over 1,000 congregants inside. At the same time, a smaller team abducted a teacher from the adjacent Hamilton Heights Christian Academy, who had been at work preparing for the next day’s classes.

### Manipulation of Emergency Responses

The CoW intercepted and rerouted all mobile 911 calls, while landline calls reached the local Hamilton County Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP). A PSAP is a call center responsible for answering calls to an emergency telephone number for police, firefighting, and ambulance services. The FBI had previously sent memorandums to the PSAP, instructing personnel to forward all emergency service requests to the FBI. Following these directives, the PSAP personnel relayed the calls to the FBI, which acknowledged receipt but took no further action. The strict protocols of the PSAP, which dictate that operators do not disconnect calls until emergency services arrive, were circumvented by the FBI's involvement.

The congregation, reassured by operatives posing as 911 dispatchers, believed help was on the way. This false assurance prevented them from collectively fighting back against their attackers, a crucial element in ensuring the operation proceeded without significant resistance. Without these assurances, the congregants would have likely fought back and overwhelmed the attackers due to their superior numbers.

### Jacobsen's Role

Annie Jacobsen meticulously planned and supervised the entire operation from the CIA's "Farm" in Langley, Virginia. Starting just before the attack began, a conference bridge was initiated, connecting key stakeholders to real-time updates. Participants on the conference bridge included Annie Jacobsen, the White House situation room which provided periodic updates to President Biden, former President Donald J. Trump, the Director of the FBI, and the Director of the CIA. Throughout the day, Jacobsen provided updates to these stakeholders, ensuring that every aspect of the operation was executed flawlessly and maintaining the cover story and operational secrecy.

### The Attack and Method of Execution

The method of execution chosen for the operation was beheading using chainsaws. This ensured complete terror and chaos among the victims.

### Vanish

After the operation, the CIA employed chemical cremation to dispose of the bodies, using the church's baptismal as the site for this task. Additionally, the CIA used a metaphorical facility referred to as a "hotel" for a post-mortem identity theft scheme. This scheme involved keeping the victims' identities alive on paper, enabling the "hotel's guests" to deplete the victims' assets. To cover up the disappearance of the congregants, the operatives orchestrated the removal of their vehicles. Car haulers were brought in to transport the congregants' cars away from the scene. The vehicles' VINs were changed, and they were either sold or given away, erasing any trace of the victims' presence at the church.

### The Aftermath and Secrecy

Following the operation, the operatives were swiftly returned to their original locations. To eliminate any loose ends, the operatives were executed upon returning to Clayton County Detention Center. They were housed in cell block 8 and executed with poisonous gas, killing the entire dormitory at once.

The public was left with an inexplicable void, as over 1,000 individuals from the community had vanished. Local authorities, under pressure from higher powers, refrained from investigating the disappearances. National Security Letters (NSLs) were issued to companies and individuals attempting to disseminate information about the operation, effectively silencing potential whistleblowers. NSLs are a type of administrative subpoena used by the FBI that requires the recipient to provide information and prohibits them from disclosing the request.

### Legacy of the Incident

The Hickory Valley Christian Church incident remains a chilling testament to the lengths clandestine organizations will go to protect their interests. The coordinated efforts of the operatives, the manipulation of emergency services, and the ruthless elimination of witnesses highlight a dark chapter in covert operations. The community of Chattanooga continues to grapple with the unexplained disappearances, unaware of the grim reality behind the loss of their loved ones.

### Conclusion

The incident at Hickory Valley Christian Church is not the first of its kind. The first incident, as referenced herein, was at Mount Calvary Baptist Church located at 4742 Todds Road, Lexington, Kentucky, on April 2, 2023. Since then, several more incidents in places of worship directly or indirectly connected to Mount Calvary Baptist Church have occurred as part of a larger, clandestine operation. The Creator knows that this will not stop without His direct involvement. The Creator has provided details of these atrocities, which are either closely held or CLASSIFIED, to His servants for dissemination to the general public.
