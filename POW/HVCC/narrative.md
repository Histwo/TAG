# The Mother's Day Massacre at Hickory Valley Christian Church

Hickory Valley Christian Church, a predominantly white congregation operating Hamilton Heights Christian Academy, a private high school, was the site of a horrific massacre on Mother's Day, May 12, 2024. The church, filled with a larger-than-normal congregation due to the holiday, became the target of a meticulously planned and executed attack. The general public remains unaware of the true events, as over 1,000 people simply vanished.

## Background 

Hickory Valley Christian Church was targeted after Kelvin Williams, concerned for the safety of the church and it’s school, attempted to warn the clergy about potential threats. Kelvin Williams is now the only living member of Mount Calvary Baptist Church located at 4742 Todd Road in Lexington, Kentucky, and the cousin of its pastor the Rev. Dr. Felix G. Williams, III. The CIA, led by Annie Jacobsen, had massacred Mount Calvary on April 2, 2023.

Kelvin was introduced to Duke Stone by Bonnie Bush Ford in 2004. Bonnie Bush Ford, a retired elementary school teacher and principal, was a great friend of Kelvin and the cousin of former Presidents George H. W. Bush and George W. Bush. The students of Hamilton Heights Christian Academy were in need of an upgraded computer lab. Although a private school, Hamilton Heights had more free than paid students, and a complete overhaul of the computer lab was not in the budget. Bonnie persuaded Kelvin to assist the school with whatever he could. Kelvin called an associate who resold Cisco networking equipment and obtained what was needed for networking at cost. Kelvin purchased or borrowed the tools, cabling, and connectors. Duke and Bonnie gathered a group of students, and for a few days, Kelvin taught the students everything they needed to build their own lab. The students performed the labor while Kelvin supervised and tested their work. As a network engineer by trade who at the time ran his own business, Kelvin to provide technical assistance whenever needed to the church and school while he lived in Chattanooga.

Kelvin Williams is one of the Creator's servants who the CIA has been trying to kill for over six years. This began when Kelvin was identified during an investigation by medical professionals as attempting “something” that made HIV disappear in an HIV-positive individual. Gilead Sciences first ordered him and his friend killed after a routine viral load test could not find the protein that accompanies HIV, which is always detected even when the patient is considered undetectable.

## Targeted 

Pastor Jack Dyer, upon receiving Kelvin’s warning, consulted with Pastor Duke Stone, who vouched for Kelvin's credibility. Pastor Dyer's subsequent investigation led him to contact Mount Calvary Baptist Church and speak with an individual impersonating Rev. Dr. Felix G. Williams, III. Realizing the person was an continued impostor, Pastor Dyer and Pastor Stone began discussing the potential threat with others. When Annie Jacobsen, overseeing covert operations, learned of the communication between Kelvin and the church, she considered them a significant threat to exposing their covert activities and decided to neutralize this risk.

## Operatives

One hundred inmates from various prisons within the Georgia Department of Corrections were carefully selected to carry out the attack. Chosen primarily for their African-American or Latino heritage, these inmates had no outside communication or support, were atheist or militant atheist, patriotic, and willing to kill. Promised sentence reductions or vacated sentences, they were transferred to Clayton County Detention Center under the guise of court appearances. 

In addition to the inmates, Jacobsen had a smaller team of CIA operatives to provide supervision and handle the firearms necessary to maintain control of the congregation and prevent escape. As congregants who attempted to escape had to be shot.

## The Attack

Just before the attack began, a conference call was established, connecting various stakeholders including the White House situation room, which provided periodic updates to President Biden, former President Donald J. Trump himself, the Director of the FBI, and the Director of the CIA. Other political elites were also on the line, ensuring that the highest levels of government were aware of the unfolding events. Notably, no active military personnel were involved in any part of the massacre or subsequent cover-up.

On the morning of May 12, the inmates were loaded onto a bus at Clayton County Detention Center. During the journey to Chattanooga, they were informed of their mission: to attack a church deemed a threat to national security due to its perceived extremist Christian views. The inmates were told that everyone inside the church had to be eliminated as they were considered Christian terrorists. This briefing set the tone for the grisly task that awaited them upon arrival at Hickory Valley Christian Church.

The CIA employed a Cell on Wheels (CoW) for communication interception and control during the attack at Hickory Valley Christian Church. This covert vehicle, disguised as a regular passenger vehicle, operated by intercepting mobile phone signals within its vicinity. Its configuration specified that any mobile calls made to 911 within the targeted area would be connected to a separate team of CIA operatives who were already briefed on the ongoing attack. These operatives, posing as 911 dispatchers, aimed to placate the callers and prevent any local emergency response.

Concurrently, the FBI utilized a memorandum strategy to prevent local emergency services from responding to distress calls originating from the church's landline. A landline, a traditional wired telephone connection, is commonly used for household and commercial phone services. The memorandum, sent to the Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP), instructed them to forward any requests for emergency services to the FBI for coordination and dispatch. Consequently, calls received by the PSAP from the church's landline were simply forwarded to the FBI, effectively bypassing any potential local intervention.

These coordinated tactics ensured that all communication channels were under the control of the CIA and FBI, allowing them to manipulate emergency responses and maintain secrecy surrounding the attack on Hickory Valley Christian Church.

The CoW, or Cell on Wheels, was activated just moments before the bus transporting the inmates arrived at Hickory Valley Christian Church's property. This timing was crucial to ensure seamless communication interception and control during the execution of the attack. As the bus approached the church's parking lot or property, the CoW began its operation, intercepting mobile phone signals and redirecting any emergency calls made within its range (up to 0.5 miles) to the designated CIA operatives. This proactive activation of the CoW allowed the CIA to establish immediate control over communication channels, facilitating their manipulation of emergency responses and ensuring the success of their covert operation at the church.

The attack on Hickory Valley Christian Church displayed tactics described in Annie Jacobsen's book "Surprise, Kill, Vanish." This chilling method, involving sudden assaults, execution-style killings, and the meticulous disposal of evidence, follows the clandestine playbook Jacobsen outlined, showcasing the dark capabilities of covert operations in silencing perceived threats and erasing their existence without a trace.

### Surprise

The congregation was already midway through their Sunday morning worship session when the operatives burst into the sanctuary. Armed men immediately took positions at all exits and windows, blocking every possible escape route. Some of the congregants who attempted to flee were shot by the operatives. Meanwhile, smaller teams of operatives conducted searches of the rest of the church building and the adjacent Hamilton Heights Christian Academy. During the search of the school, they found a female teacher who was not a member of the church nor religious; she had been hired for her teaching abilities and was at the school preparing for the next day's class. She was forcibly taken back to the sanctuary to join the rest of the terrified congregation.

#### 911 Disconnected

Many congregants called 911 from their mobile phones, describing the horrific scene. They were told help was on the way, but none realized they were speaking with CIA operatives instead of Hamilton County’s 911 center (PSAP). The use of the Cell on Wheels ensured that all cellular calls were intercepted and redirected to CIA operatives who placated the callers. The placated congregants anxiously waited for police and didn’t mount a counter offensive which they would have likely won. 

### Kill

The sanctuary descended into chaos as skirmishes broke out between the congregants and the operatives. Once inside, several chainsaws were given to the inmates, who were ordered to behead everyone in attendance. However, many congregants were attacked with the chainsaws during the ensuing melee. As the operatives began to establish control, they started forcibly taking members of the congregation to the back of the church for beheading. Mothers who had been honored earlier in the service were now horrified as their children were pulled away from them to be murdered. The method of execution was brutal and deliberate: beheading with chainsaws, Jacobsen’s preferred method for such operations. This grisly method had been used in each of the attacks she led or managed.

### Vanish

Following the massacre, the bodies of the victims were disposed of using chemical cremation in the church's baptismal, ensuring no physical evidence remained. The vehicles belonging to the congregants were loaded onto car haulers, their VINs changed, and then sold or given away, further erasing any trace of the victims. The CIA also employed a scheme metaphorically referred to as a "hotel” for each adult victim, which involves post-mortem identity theft and impersonation to deplete the victims’ assets and keep them "alive" on paper.

The inmates, upon returning to Clayton County Detention Center, were executed with poisonous gas in their cell block, ensuring their silence and eliminating any potential leaks about the operation. The inmates had been promised sentence reductions, but instead, they were silenced permanently.

To the public, the government has said absolutely nothing. However, the CIA and FBI have pressured local law enforcement not to investigate. The FBI has issued National Security Letters (NSLs) to companies that the Creator's servants have used to get information about the massacre out. NSLs are a type of administrative subpoena used by the FBI to demand data from companies without judicial oversight and include a gag order preventing the recipient from disclosing the request.

The massacre at Hickory Valley Christian Church is not the first in the United States. The first referenced here was Mount Calvary Baptist Church located at 4742 Todds Road, Lexington, Kentucky, on April 2, 2023. Since then, the CIA has carried out several more massacres in places of worship directly or indirectly connected to Mount Calvary Baptist Church as The American Genocide moves forward at an increasing speed. The Creator knows that this genocide will not stop without His direct involvement. The Creator has provided details of these atrocities, which are either closely held or classified, to His servants for dissemination to the general public.
