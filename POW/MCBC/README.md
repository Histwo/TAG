# The Chainsaw Symphony: The First Congregation of TAG
## Lexington, Kentucky — April 2, 2023

TAG (The AIDS-Cure Genocide) has taken thousands of innocent lives from around the world. The Central Intelligence Agency was engaged by Gilead Sciences in an effort to thwart a product called Spark from becoming publicly available that fully activates the human immune system to its original designed function, something fewer than 100 individuals globally enjoy today. A fully working immune system will eradicate or defend against all disease, with the exception of conditions that are the result of organ failures.

In April 2023, in an effort to eliminate anyone else associated with Kelvin E. Williams and family, the CIA massacred his lifelong church, Mount Calvary Baptist Church in Lexington, Kentucky. Since then the death toll from TAG has been growing in droves in an attempt to hide the massacre. Williams is the individual identified as providing Spark to HIV-cured patients.

On April 2nd, 2023 in the quiet, remote area on the eastern side of Lexington, Kentucky, stands the picturesque Mount Calvary Baptist Church. Its red brick walls, stained-glass windows and modest steeple belied the horrors that would soon unfold within its sacred confines.

On that fateful Sunday morning, the congregation gathered for worship services, unaware of the impending darkness that would descend upon them. Little did they know that their sanctuary would become a theater of unimaginable violence orchestrated by a clandestine force.

### The CIA's Ruthless Assault

Annie Jacobsen, a seasoned operative with the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), led a team of fifty men and one woman. Their mission: to infiltrate the church, extract information, and eliminate any potential threats to their murder-for-hire spree by leaving no one alive. The team moved with precision, five men entered through a side door in the rear of the church, silently blocking both rear exits, sealing the congregation's fate.  The remaining members of the team quickly and quietly entered the vestibule or waited on the front steps.

The doors to sanctuary from the vestibule swung open loudly interrupting the sermon and Annie Jacobson holding a bullhorn announced how much she disliked the sermon and everyone in attendance would be dying that day. Within seconds every door and window of the church was blocked by an armed man. The congregation was trapped and the horror set in.

### Desperate Calls to 911

Inside the church, panic erupted as congregants realized their dire situation. Some reached for their mobile phones, desperate to call for help. But a rogue Cell on Wheels (or COW), strategically positioned in the church parking lot, caused every mobile phone within a quarter-mile to connect to it. The configuration of this covert mobile tower operated by the CIA rerouted all calls to 911 directly to a separate team of CIA personnel with prior knowledge of the operation. All other calls and mobile services failed. 

Desperate voices pleaded for assistance, unaware that their cries fell on deaf ears. The CIA agents, feigning concern, assured callers that first responders were being dispatched. But in reality, their fate had already been sealed.

### The Betrayal of the FBI

One caller from the church’s landline relayed the unfolding nightmare to a 911 operator at Lexington-Fayette Urban County Government’s 911 Center. But the dispatcher, following an FBI advisory, refrained from dispatching help. Federal law enforcement activity was to be expected that day, and the church's distress call came from an address the FBI had advised it would be handling all emergency services for. 

### Chainsaw Symphony 

The CIA team descended upon the congregation, pulling families apart. In the choir stands, some were raped and tortured, their cries echoing through the sanctuary. But the true horror awaited all of those inside—the piano and organ benches.

Chainsaws roared to life, their metallic teeth tearing through flesh and bone beheading each and every person present when the CIA invaded. Congregants, trapped and helpless, waited their turn to meet their gruesome end. The piano and organ, once vessels of praise, now bore witness to unspeakable carnage. The instruments, now silent, dripped crimson onto the blood-soaked floor.

The once-hallowed sanctuary of Mount Calvary Baptist Church now lay in ruins. Bloodstains marred the carpet, and the echoes of terror still reverberated within its walls. 

### The Baptismal Turned Crematorium

Members of the CIA's ruthless team had repurposed the church's full-immersion baptismal. What was once a sacred vessel for spiritual rebirth now served as a macabre crematorium. Chemical agents mingled with the holy water, turning it into a caustic solution that consumed the remains of the faithful.

### Erasing All Traces

Outside, car haulers stood ready. Vehicles that had carried the unsuspecting congregation that morning were loaded onto these trailers. Other CIA operatives drove the cars away from the church's property. The evidence of their brutality vanished with each departing vehicle.

Inside the sanctuary, chaos had given way to methodical destruction. Choir stands, once adorned with hymnals and voices raised in praise, were now splintered remnants. The church’s altar and lectern met the same fate. The organ and piano, once conduits of heavenly melodies, were dismantled and discarded.

### A Cherub’s Church

Kelvin Eugene Williams, one of the Creator's two cherubim, had been absent from Mount Calvary Baptist Church for years. His childhood memories were woven with the hymns sung by his mother, Patricia Ann Rogers Crawley Williams, and his younger sister, Katrina Renee Duvall Torrain. But life had taken him away from those sacred walls.

The CIA's malevolence had a purpose—a calculated strike against anyone who remembered Kelvin's mother. She had been an active force within the church, her faith unwavering. Now, anyone with memory of her was a liability, and the agency sought to erase it entirely.

### "Sign of the Times"

Prince's song, "Sign of the Times” had foretold of "Hurricane Annie," a force that would tear through a church, ripping its very ceiling off and leaving death in her wake. 

### The Aftermath

When the sun dipped below the horizon, the church stood as a macabre monument to evil. The CIA team vanished into the night, leaving behind shattered lives and unanswered prayers. 

Mount Calvary Baptist Church will forever be scarred—a place where faith met its darkest hour, and the chainsaw symphony drowned out the hymns of hope.
