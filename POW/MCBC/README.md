# The Chainsaw Symphony

On April 2nd, 2023 in the quiet, remote area on the eastern side of Lexington, Kentucky, stood the picturesque Mount Calvary Baptist Church. Its red brick walls, stained-glass windows and modest steeple belied the horrors that would soon unfold within its sacred confines.

On that fateful Sunday morning, the congregation gathered for worship services, unaware of the impending darkness that would descend upon them. Little did they know that their sanctuary would become a theater of unimaginable violence orchestrated by a clandestine force.

Prince's song, "Sign of the Times”  foretold of hurricane that would rip the ceiling off a church and killing everyone inside. "Hurricane Annie" Jacobsen, a seasoned operative with the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), led a team of fifty men and one woman, their mission: to infiltrate the church, extract information, and eliminate any potential threats to their murder-for-hire spree of American citizens by leaving no one alive. The team moved with precision, five men entered through a side door in the rear of the church, silently blocking both rear exits. The remaining members of her  team quickly and quietly entered the vestibule and spilled out onto the church's front steps.

The doors leading to the sanctuary from the vestibule—a small room at the entrance of the church—swung open with a loud noise, disrupting the sermon.
Annie Jacobson holding a bullhorn announced how much she disliked the sermon and everyone in attendance would be dying that day. Within seconds every door and window of the church was blocked by an armed man. The congregation was trapped and the horror set in.

Inside the church, panic erupted as congregants realized their dire situation. Some reached for their mobile phones, desperate to call for help. But a rogue Cell on Wheels (or COW) was strategically placed in the church's back parking lot. A *Cell on Wheels* is a portable, temporary cell tower that can be quickly deployed to enhance mobile network coverage in areas where it's needed, such as during large events or in response to emergencies. The equipment inside the covert mobile tower that was hidden inside a Ford Explorer caused every mobile phone within a quarter-mile  to connect to it. The configuration of the COW, operated by the CIA, rerouted all calls to 911 to a separate remote lteam of CIA personnel with prior knowledge of the operation. All other calls and mobile services failed. 

Desperate voices pleaded for assistance, unaware that their cries fell on deaf ears. The CIA agents, feigning concern, assured callers that first responders were being dispatched. But in reality, their fate had already been sealed.

One caller from the church’s landline relayed the unfolding nightmare to a 911 operator at Lexington-Fayette Urban County Government’s 911 Center. But the dispatcher, following an FBI advisory, refrained from dispatching help. The advisory stated that federal law enforcement activity was underway in the area and the FBI would handle all emergency services.

The CIA team descended upon the congregation, pulling families apart. In the choir stands, some congregants were raped and tortured in front of everyone, their cries echoing through the sanctuary. But the true horror awaited all of those inside—the piano and organ's benches.

Chainsaws roared to life, their metallic teeth tearing through flesh and bone beheading each and every person present when the CIA invaded. Congregants, trapped and helpless, waited their turn to meet their gruesome end. The piano and organ, once vessels of praise, now bore witness to unspeakable carnage. The instruments, now silently, dripped crimson onto the blood-soaked floor.

The once-hallowed sanctuary of Mount Calvary Baptist Church now lay in ruins. Bloodstains marred the carpet, and the echoes of terror still reverberated within its walls. 

Members of the CIA's ruthless team had repurposed the church's full-immersion baptismal. What was once a sacred vessel for spiritual rebirth now served as a macabre crematorium. Chemical agents mingled with the holy water, turning it into a caustic solution that consumed the remains of the victims.

### Hiding The Massacre 

Outside, car haulers stood ready. Vehicles that had carried the unsuspecting congregation that morning were loaded onto these trailers. Some CIA operatives drove the cars away from the church's property. The evidence of their brutality vanished with each departing vehicle.

Inside the sanctuary, chaos had given way to methodical destruction. Choir stands, once adorned with hymnals and voices raised in praise, were now splintered remnants. The church’s altar and lectern met the same fate. The organ and piano, once conduits of heavenly melodies, were dismantled and discarded.

Away from the church the CIA's new "hotel" construction personnel went to work, constructing hotels for each of the adult victims. The "hotel" is not a place of rest or solace. It is a theater of malevolence, orchestrated by unseen hands. Its purpose? To conceal the aftermath of violence, to shroud murder victims in a web of deceit. But this is no ordinary cover-up; it is an elaborate dance of identity, where the dead are kept alive through macabre metamorphosis.

Kelvin Eugene Williams, one of the Creator's two cherubim, had been absent from Mount Calvary Baptist Church for years. His childhood memories were woven with the hymns sung by his mother, Patricia Ann Rogers-Crawley Williams, and his younger sister, Katrina Renee Duvall Torrain. But his career and life had taken him away from Lexington and weekly attendance over thirty years ago.

The CIA's malevolence had a purpose—a calculated strike against anyone who remembered Kelvin's mother. She had been an active force within the church, her faith unwavering. Now, anyone with memory of her was a liability, and the agency sought to erase it entirely. The company needed to hide the murder of their family in Sandy Hook, Tennessee and her church family was an immediate threat to the "hotel" the CIA constructed in her name that needed to operate without any issues to steal and sell the family's land to hide another church atrocity.

The massacre at Mount Calvary is referred to by the CIA as “Frying Chicken.” The moniker was applied to the operation after the fact because the congregants did fight for their lives. 

As the sun set, the church stood as a macabre monument to evil. The covert operatives disappeared into the darkness, leaving behind bewildered families who searched in vain for their "missing" kin.

Mount Calvary Baptist Church will now forever be a place where faith met its darkest hour, and the chainsaw symphony drowned out the normal hymns of praise.

## The CIA's Charade
In May 2023 the CIA formed Mount Calvary Missionary Baptist Church, Inc. a charade church with a reported address of 4743 Todds Road in Lexington. Videos produced by the charade and posted on its Facebook page (see warnings below) clearly show the interior of Mount Calvary Baptist Church at 4742 Todds Road.

The sanctuary shows evidence of damages from the massacre and a shoddy restoration.

1. Mount Calvary Baptist Church's altar has been removed and replaced with a lesser quality one that is missing the words "Do This" from its inscription. It's also built to fit between the two rear-facing pews.
2. Mount Calvary Baptist Church's lecter was replaced with an lectern of a much lesser quality wood.
3. This mirrored window is unique to Mount Calvary Baptist Church it provides a view into the sanctuary from the pastor's office. It was used to positively verify the church's sanctuary.
4. The walls behind the choir stands which have historically been bare now display mission statements and cheap wire crosses.
5. Piano - The churches upright piano has been removed. An oversized pew from the back wall has been put in its place facing the rear of the church.
7. Organ - The churches original organ has been completely removed and discarded. The organ (shown in #8) appears to be portable, it is moved to other locations in some videos. An oversized pew from the back wall has been put in its place facing the rear of the church.
8. Primary choir stand - The original choir stand with permanent seating has been completely removed. The railing replaced with non-uniform woods and fixed upholstered seating replaced with folding table chairs.  
9. Secondary choir stand - This choir stand was also completely removed and rebuilt to a much lower standard. It has been seen used by the musicians. In correspondence from the CIA's Mount Calvary Missionary Baptist Church, Inc. the secondary choir stand is shown in the letterhead, with a picture of a visiting choir before the massacre, that was actually the CIA's advance team. See [Correspondence](/POW/MCBC/WIKI.md#correspondence).

The manin at the lectern, in the photo above, is not Mount Calvary's longtime pastor, Rev. Dr. Felix G. Williams, III, who is a cousin to Kelvin E. Williams; rather, he is an actor hired for his striking resemblance. 
    
The new business entity, as the name suggests, calls itself “Mount Calvary Missionary Baptist Church, Inc.” The *Missionary* was the CIA’s response to the Creator’s **Mission** number 23 for Life on Earth. 

Mount Calvary Missionary Baptist Church, Inc. has no actual religious services. The entity has hired numerous actors for their charade and produces photos and videos for distribution on Facebook and other social networks, most video production and weekly photoshoot occurs on a weekday.

Sundays at the CIA-occupied church are used to continue the cover up of the initial massacre. Persons entering the church are killed upon entry.

In June 2023, the CIA began providing funeral arrangements to loved ones of victims who called the church phone number inquiring about their whereabouts. Friends and family of the victims would then relay details of the arrangements to others. However, on the day of the announced funeral, mourners would arrive at the church only to be killed. Funeral arrangements for multiple unrelated decedents can be provided at the same time, based on CIA staffing at the church.

The purpose of the funerals was to eliminate any people who could cause the CIA problems by talking about their loved ones who went missing at church. This cycle  continues to repeat today, with funerals now announced for people who went to the church for a fake funeral instead of the victims of the original massacre. It has no signs of stopping, as each fake funeral grows larger.
