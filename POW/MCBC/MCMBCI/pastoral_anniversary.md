It was announced in a way that I've never seen any church celebration done before. Normally, they're added to the church announcements which my mother used to read each Sunday morning.

They want you to believe that my whole family gathered at Mount Calvary Baptist Church and we all did our part to celebrate the Rev. Dr. Felix G. Williams, III’s 40th Pastoral Anniversary.

The event was the biggest, most advertised, event since the massacre at Mount Calvary Baptist Church. Advertisements for the event on social media even showed Mount Calvary hosting a visiting church and guest speaker. The problem is the visiting church and guest speaker were both charades and according to the Creator, and have never prayed.

I do not ever get the specifics of anyone’s prayers, but I can get summary or aggregate information when needed, and now it seems, whenever I need to validate if a church is even religious.

The whole anniversary celebration was just every shade of wrong. I was at home at the CIA-kill facility, Legacy at Riverdale, in Riverdale, GA when a man who resembles the younger, much heavier me, stepped to the podium. The man resembled what most in central Kentucky remember when they think of me.

The truth is, I was right here in Riverdale, completing what I considered to be an odd task for the Creator: taking a selfie with something showing the time and date (ignore the CIA minder in the background). We are just dumb servants, we just do, never asking the when’s or why’s.

The CIA operating on flawed intelligence got this wrong, while ordained, I’ve never stood behind the lectern and given an address. I’ve never stood behind Mount Calvary Baptist Church’s lectern, the only time I was in a position that would have placed me been directly behind it, the lectern had been moved, and I was freezing cold — I was in the baptismal, being baptized by the Rev. Dr. Felix G. Williams, III.

I will never stand behind Mount Calvary Baptist Church’s lectern, as it was destroyed on or about Sunday, April 2nd, 2023 — the day of the massacre. The unauthorized replacement I wouldn’t even think of ever standing behind, I’m trying to get the company-church that put it there out. Mount Calvary Missionary Baptist Church, Inc. has beliefs and practices that we as a church never entertained or performed.

One of the biggest differences in doctrine between the church and company-church, we the church and actual owners of the property believe we should welcome people from all walks of life, and try make them as comfortable as possible. We put that into practice every time a visitor showed up, we confirmed our beliefs when they’d leave, by telling them we wanted them to come back soon and often.

Annie Jacobsen can testify to all but the last bit, she was welcomed and made comfortable. Annie cannot say that my church family welcomed her back or wanted to see her again because she interrupted services and massacred everyone that Sunday.

The company-church she installed that is now illegally occupying our property does not share any of our doctrine. While they believe they should welcome everyone (especially those who knew our church), they believe they must kill everyone isn’t an employees and contractor of the CIA. They are putting these beliefs into practice too.

That is not a difference in doctrine, which would mean a new denomination. That’s a whole new religion.

You see, the 40th Pastoral Anniversary was all a photoshoot by and for the CIA, intended to be used as a tool to welcome outsiders in. It is important to note, the event wasn’t even done on a Sunday. Sundays are workdays for the new company-church, a day set aside to kill any unsuspecting worshippers who venture onto Mount Calvary Baptist Church’s property.

Everything you see from the new Mount Calvary Missionary Baptist Church, Inc. or “company-church” is planned, rehearsed, staged and photographed — sometimes with professional photographers. If you noticed an odd name for a church, it’s theirs. I first seen it when I wrote my church after I was told of the massacre, and the new company-church responded.

The wrong doesn’t end there, they have what appears to be my mother, my niece, and my sister in the choir stand, all giving their staged smiles and looks of approval to what’s supposed to be my cousin, the pastor of Mount Calvary Baptist Church.

My mother would have told you that she couldn’t carry a tune in a five gallon bucket. I believe she did try out for the choir once, I think they encouraged her to serve the Lord in other way, she became an usher instead. So for her to be sitting in the choir stand was the first thing I noticed as just plain wrong.

This is my actual niece Kennedy and my actual mother Patricia. Both murdered in October 2022.

If you think I should have noticed those occupying the foreground of the image, you’re probably right. However, I now just gloss over him if he’s not moving or talking because I already know, he’s not there or going to be in any photo the CIA produces, see The Pride of the CIA.

They featured the woman who resembled my mother, as she presented an award to the model couple who resembled Rev. Dr. Felix G. Williams, III and his wife.

I know my mother did not present anything to the Rev. Dr. Felix G. Williams, III anything. I know this for certain, the CIA murdered them both.

This is supposed to be my sister Katrina and my aunt Emma Jean, it’s neither. My sister is pregnant and the photo below, this woman is just naturally bigger.

Karrington my niece and Katrina my sister, who was pregnant at the time.

None of them were at the “40th pastoral anniversary” that was advertised and the pictures shown here are still online to give credibility to the company-church’s charade. I know them, it’s not them, and in case you didn’t get it, it’s not me either.

Before the CIA tells you otherwise, it’s not Felix. His ecclesiastical clergy ring is in my possession, he never removed it. I’m assuming to delivered to me full of pride, I don’t know exactly why. Haven’t asked either. It was either to brag about doing the massacre, or in an attempt to further elicit my suicide.

I wrote an open letter to the CIA about their photo shoot and the use of impersonators to sell their charade, you can read it here on the mission23 wiki. I should probably edit it, it has some foul language.

My entire family and church family have been killed in the past two years. I think I’m allowed to drop an F-bomb or two.

Do you know what the US government has dropped or detonated to cover this up? If it weren’t for the Creator, my Boss, none of us would be reading this right now.

“If night falls and a bomb falls, will anybody see the dawn.”

If He knew enough to send Prince and Mark Heidinger of Vandaveer their lyrics, He knows exactly what to do to handle an Earth-killing bomb. He does keep us alive, not because of Mount Calvary in particular, but the 8+ billion other human beings we serve.

He may not have been keeping us alive for my church, but He did talk to us, and told us we were immortal because of it.

So, guess I’m stuck being that motherfucker Langley says I am for the duration.
