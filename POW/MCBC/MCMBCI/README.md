# Mount Calvary Missionary Baptist Church, Inc.

Mount Calvary Missionary Baptist Church, Inc. is alleged to have been a front established by the CIA to cover up and perpetuate a cycle of murders linked to the church. According to this account, the CIA took control of the church's property and manipulated it to eliminate individuals connected to victims of an initial massacre. They achieved this by announcing fake funerals for those who inquired about their missing loved ones. When mourners attended these funerals, they too were killed, thus perpetuating the cycle and eliminating potential threats to the CIA.

The address 4743 Todds Road, which is associated with the Mount Calvary Baptist Church cemetery, was used to mislead people, whereas the actual church's address is 4742 Todds Road. The "Missionary" addition to the church's name is seen as a mockery of Kelvin Williams' mission from the Creator.

This pattern of deceit and violence continues to this day, with each fake funeral growing larger as it now includes victims who attended previous fake funerals, further entrenching the cycle. This narrative implies that the purpose is to eliminate any individuals who might expose or question the original events and the ongoing cover-up.
