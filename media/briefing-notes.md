# Media Briefing: The American Genocide (TAG)

## 1. Introduction
   - **Opening Statement:**
     - This briefing addresses the urgent and ongoing crisis known as The American Genocide (TAG), a multi-phase operation with devastating implications for the nation and humanity at large.
     - TAG is a covert, orchestrated campaign whose scale and complexity demand immediate attention and action.

## 2. Overview of TAG
   - **What is TAG?**
     - TAG is a hidden genocide orchestrated by powerful political elites and governmental agencies with the ultimate goal of installing former President Donald J. Trump as the supreme leader of a new authoritarian regime.
     - It represents a systematic dismantling of democratic values and institutions in favor of an oppressive, autocratic order.

   - **Historical Context:**
     - TAG’s origins lie in a coordinated effort to suppress progress, exemplified by:
       - Gilead Sciences' rejection of Spark, a groundbreaking cure for HIV, and its subversion to serve authoritarian interests.
       - The exploitation of political and institutional frameworks to manipulate public health, economics, and civil liberties for nefarious purposes.
     - The CIA and other influential entities have played pivotal roles, disguising TAG under the guise of national security and stabilization efforts.

   - **Scope and Scale of the Genocide:**
     - TAG targets political dissidents, marginalized groups, and anyone who opposes the authoritarian agenda.
     - It infiltrates media, politics, and society, operating in secrecy while silencing dissent and erasing evidence of atrocities.

## 3. The Four Horsemen of TAG

   ### The White Horse Event
   - The White Horse represents the rise of authoritarianism. This phase begins with establishing control, dismantling democratic systems, and legitimizing an oppressive regime.
   - Key elements include reshaping societal norms to facilitate compliance and suppress resistance, laying the groundwork for the broader genocidal agenda.

   ### The Red Horse Event
   - The Red Horse signifies escalating violence and chaos, marked by widespread persecution, suppression of dissent, and civil unrest.
   - **Key Atrocities:**
     - The Sanctuary Massacre, targeting seven churches:
       - Mount Calvary Baptist Church
       - Lexington Bethel Baptist Church
       - House of God (Georgetown Street)
       - House of God (Broadway)
       - Mount Zion Baptist Church
       - Calvary Baptist Church
       - Hickory Valley Christian Church in Chattanooga, TN
     - "Hurricane Annie" Jacobsen's role in escalating violence.
   - **Tactics to Obscure Atrocities:**
     - Suppression of missing persons reports.
     - Use of phantom funerals to conceal victims:
       - Rev. Dr. Duke Stone and Zachary Stone were manipulated to entrap Senator Marsha Blackburn and other key figures.
       - The coordinated "Multiple Unrelated Decedent Funerals" served to maintain the veil of secrecy.

   ### The Black Horse Event (Phantom Pantries)
   - The Black Horse introduces economic warfare through "phantom pantries," exploiting church properties impacted by the Sanctuary Massacres to orchestrate food scarcity.
   - This phase targets impoverished communities, ensuring their systematic elimination through deprivation of basic resources.

   ### The Pale Horse Event (MOAB)
   - The Pale Horse represents the most catastrophic phase, marked by the use of weapons of mass destruction, such as the MOAB (Mother of All Bombs), deployed in southwest Atlanta.
   - **Key Impacts:**
     - Massive civilian casualties and irreversible environmental destruction.
     - The psychological toll on survivors, compounded by the decimation of resistance efforts.
   - The demographics of Southwest Atlanta (SWATs) highlight the systematic targeting of vulnerable populations in this phase.

## 4. The Role of the Creator in TAG
   - **Interventions by the Creator:**
     - The Creator, an omnipotent and omniscient force, plays a central role in counteracting TAG, marking the intervention as part of the second coming of Jesus as foretold in the Book of Revelation.
     - The Creator’s mission is to disrupt the genocide, protect humanity, and ensure justice prevails.
   - **Divine Mission:**
     - The Creator has entrusted His servants with a special mission:
       - The Creator's two servants work tirelessly to expose TAG, mobilize opposition, and safeguard the most vulnerable.
       - Their efforts bring a moral and spiritual counterbalance to the forces driving the genocide, reinforcing hope and resilience.

## 5. The Aftermath: What Happens Post-Apocalypse?
   - **Post-TAG Vision:**
     - After the resolution of TAG, humanity must rebuild, focusing on:
       - Restoring democratic systems and ensuring accountability for those responsible.
       - Reforming social, economic, and political structures to prevent future atrocities.
   - **Future Missions:**
     - The Creator’s ongoing support includes:
       - Spark: A divine gift for restoring immune systems and eradicating HIV.
       - Future gifts addressing cancer and cardiovascular issues, fostering a healthier and more equitable world.

## 6. Call to Action
   - **Awareness and Advocacy:**
     - The media and public must remain vigilant, exposing TAG’s hidden operations and advocating for justice.
     - Supporting victims and dismantling the structures enabling genocide are critical steps toward ending TAG.
   - **Support for Resistance:**
     - Solidarity with those opposing TAG is essential, as they risk their lives to bring the truth to light and challenge the regime’s power.

## 7. Conclusion

     - The Creator’s role ensures that hope, justice, and resistance endure even in the darkest moments.
