And the corporate sponsor who has funded and enjoyed so much rape and murder.

They lack any of the substance shown in the movies.

Most Americans believe that the CIA operates as shown in the Mission Impossible or Jason Bourne series, both series are produced secretly by the CIA and are self-promotion.

The truth is, the “company” as known on the American streets where most of their operatives are recruited from, live and work — unless it’s Sunday, as of late, when they’re at church, working.

Too many of my male friends were interviewed with just three questions: Do you know Kelvin Williams? Do you know what he’s working on? Has he promised you anything related to the HIV cure? Does Kelvin have a very large penis? How big is your penis?


Some interviews ended in death if they answered with the affirmative in regard to me.

However, for those who responded answering the question about their penis size, if it exceeded the size of the Gilead Sciences’ allowed size of 7” for my friends and family, the individual was reported back to the CIA.

Armed with a list of names and filled to the brim with envy and lust, CIA and sometimes Gilead Sciences personnel and executives would pay my friends a second visit. The rape squad would then rape, sometimes anally only, torture and finally kill my friends.

According to the Creator, my male family members (the descendants of my grandmother) the CIA skipped, “Do you know Kelvin Williams?” and “How big is your penis?” They assumed the sizes for the males along sharing my maternal DNA — the descendants of my grandmother. The rape squad went in first. They never had any intention on leaving them alive.

That is how it went for all of my male family members, except Cameron Richardson. Cameron is my baby cousin, although now an adult, I remember him as my baby cousin. I’ve seen Cameron’s sports web show where he interviews University of Kentucky basketball players and such, I’m really not into sports so I ccan’t tell you much more about it. But I can say, he’s truly a good looking young man.

I’m assuming his good looks and endowments made the rape squad keep Cameron alive, full of drugs and likely losing his mind. Caneron is separated from his children, likely doesn’t know the fate of our family, and far out of his element. Cameron is a financial professional that worked at JPMorgan Chase before disappearing at the hands of the CIA’s rape squad.

After the CIA realized they had a problem with their massive land theft in Sandy Hook, Tennessee, they realized they had to keep Cameron alive for his other endowment. Cameron’s profile on LinkedIn magically reappeared the other day. So did his podcast, “Between: The Game and Life” on Apple Podcasts.

There are two rightful heirs alive of Sandy Hook, Cameron and myself. They already know I’m that motherfucker who ain’t gonna give them a goddamn thing. No amount of money is going to buy me or my family’s Sandy Hook.

They better keep betting on Cameron and their next attempt on me. I’m probably sitting in the midst of it now, given the late time and this 196 bus at the station, I’d say I am.
