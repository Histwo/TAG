Did anyone read about why Calvary Baptist Church was targeted?

Listen to "Little Packet" by M People.

Note to self: Be nice. Cocaine is very addicting. Remember being locked in the closet with Marc Bureau by Jim with him inside protecting us from nothing but Jim's wife trying to go to sleep, and what it took to talk him down. Thank you Lord for not letting Jim have one of these microwave cloaks.

Note to the overly cloaked paranoid types: Jeanette Gee couldn't have harmed a Chihuahua, and we were three grown men--Marc and I just wanted out. Jim had been up for days, maybe longer. I cant remember the exact reason why, but I do know the only person on that side of his house was Jeanette, and she was in bed trying to go to sleep. Jim stayed peeking through a crack in the door, it seemed like an hour we kept trying to tell him that it was safe to leave the damn closet. The drugs finally wore off and we finally got him to agree, we were all safe, we didn't have the endless supply line in Chattanooga--and he lived in THE exclusive party enclave the marina was just past his swimming pool.

When was the last time y'all went to sleep? Yall try the same attacks repeatedly.
