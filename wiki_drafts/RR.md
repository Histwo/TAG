The railroad activity here is beyond peculiar. Trains stop here often and remain stopped until I leave or see the graffiti.

As I type these notes the federal government is attacking me.

The train just came by around 430am, a slow, thud-thud-thud train I don't know what makes that sound but every time ive heard it here, the Boss has to do extra work restoring the area and the lives within. This visit by the passing train came just after my last drafts commit about the deadly duo (Chicago.md). This is the fourth time ive heard that in about a week and a half, never before.

The train does come by with other weaponry trained on this apartment.

The tracks look like shit, the weight of an average human can move the ties, the ground under them is horrible. Uneven gravel/grading. Im no expert but I've hung out at many railroad tracks even got high at some while skipping school with Holly Davis.  That's for "But enough on that for now" by Vandaveer Annie and gubment.

Note to self: ask Him if the federal government has ever done this elsewhere.
- He just started playing "I Move On" on  Chicago... "A moving target is hard to hit" or track, no one suspects it, cause its gone.

- The FBI did coordinate me being ran over by a train by Morningside.

(more hits incoming, committing)
