# Moto
I do not believe that Moto is your father's Motorola, or even your current police, fire or ambulance's Motorola...

The CIA stole two iPhones from me and "Danny" offered me this Moto as payment for back rent.  They needed to track my activity better I heard.. It uses a LOT MORE DATA than my iPhone did, my Internet is different (almost like split horizon)...

#Attacks increasing 

I could have sworn that Google acquired Motorola's handset business way back in 12, maybe 13, definitely NOT 14, 15, 16, or 17.
