Dear U.S. Military Personnel:

Welcome to the first and only theater for the battle of Armageddon. 

I am a servant of the Creator, one of God’s cherubim, His only two angels. If you are familiar with the Book of Revelation, I am “Whitestone.” I was born Kelvin Eugene Crawley-Rogers Williams, but at any moment my name and face will be changing. It’s confusing, but I’m the woman who gives birth to the man-child, then runs off into the wilderness (some of you are on that journey with me). The man-child is my subconscious who goes by the name, Baby or Main.

The cherubim are responsible for protecting the creation (life) and guarding God’s glory. Typically, we only serve as lifeguards and sometimes life coaches. This time we have to do both due to the desire of some to move this country towards authoritarianism and the CIA’s unwavering commitment to do just that. 

The Creator’s number one priority is the continued existence of life on this planet, as His servants we have the same priority. So We (when capitalized that means, the Creator and His two servants) are asking the military to conscientiously object to killing any innocent persons in the Atlanta area. The Creator will not allow it and has already reversed several MOAB and nuclear detonations (see Listen Also).

The CIA turbocharged an ongoing genocide here in the US, when they attacked and massacred my lifelong church, Mount Calvary Baptist Church, on April 2, 2023 during Sunday morning worship service. Mount Calvary was the first massacre, but their second church congregation. Orr Chapel which stood in the  Sandy Hook, Tennessee was destroyed and it’s members identified, located and murdered. On the path to Authoritarianism, anyone who holds someone other than the President or other high-level government or party official is a threat. Anyone who believes in a higher power, regardless of what you call it, is a significant threat. Today, there have been seven places of worship that have had their memberships murdered.

When I post this on GitHub in the “MIL” directory, I will officially be fulfilling Biblical prophecy (Revelation 18:21-24) as git is definitely a stone. I had previously thought that would be when I take a trip to “Alphabet Street” as my cousin Prince sung in a song, which is my family’s cemetery that was desecrated by the CIA when they stole the farm that made up Sandy Hook, Tennessee. 

Listen Also: “1999” by Prince – In some versions there is a child that says, “Mommy, why does everybody have a bomb?” That is a reference to the MOAB.
