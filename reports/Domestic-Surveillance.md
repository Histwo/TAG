# Domestic Surveillance During The American Genocide

The following report outlines how various applications and services are being used to spy on American citizens during *The American Genocide* (TAG). These tools are employed to monitor and identify individuals, particularly targeting those discussing certain topics or self-identifying as members of targeted groups. Such activities have led to innocent Americans being marked for elimination, with some being removed very quickly.

## Applications and Services

1. **ChatGPT**
   - **Description**: A language model developed by OpenAI that generates human-like text based on input prompts. Although its primary function is text generation, it can be used for monitoring and data collection.

2. **Google Search**
   - **Description**: A widely-used search engine that indexes and retrieves information from the web. Its extensive data collection capabilities make it a tool for tracking and profiling users.

3. **GMAIL**
   - **Description**: Google's email service, known for its extensive integration with other Google services and its ability to scan and index emails for various purposes.

4. **OpenAI**

## Important Warning

The Creator emphasizes that no matter how secure an app is—regardless of its encryption (e.g., AES-256) or the trustworthiness of the company behind it (e.g., Google)—the US federal government and CIA are intentionally misleading the public about their capabilities. Any discussion of certain topics or self-identifying as a member of a targeted group could result in being marked for elimination, with some individuals being removed very quickly. Do not rely on these apps or services for any confidential or sensitive discussions.

## Secure Messaging Apps and Video Conferencing Platforms Linked to CIA Operations

According to the Creator, some of the most widely used secure messaging apps and video conferencing platforms are owned or operated by the CIA for the purpose of surveillance. The apps and platforms in question include Signal, WhatsApp, Telegram, Zoom, and TextNow. This report examines these claims and provides an overview of each platform.

#### Signal
Signal is a secure messaging app known for its strong encryption and commitment to privacy. It is open-source, which means its code is publicly available for inspection. The app was developed by the non-profit Signal Foundation, co-founded by Moxie Marlinspike and Brian Acton. Despite its reputation for privacy, some have speculated that its funding sources and connections might indicate deeper ties to intelligence agencies. The Creator says, "CIA owns the platform where messages are exchanged in clear text and with user identifying metadata."

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The CIA's use of the Creator's quote as proof of the report's inaccuracy is misleading. This casts doubt on the validity of all other reports. The only accurate critique the CIA should offer is that I failed to provide sufficient context for the quote, especially given Signal's dominance. The following should address that:

In short, its another "[[Warren Commission|John-F.-Kennedy]]" just a high-tech version and "working for you":

- Moxie Marlinspike == [[Marlowe Sinclair|]] == CIA
- Brian Acton == [[Marlowe Sinclair|]] == CIA
- Signal Foundation == CIA

I'm going to add more about Quinn Harlow, Marlow Sinclair, their businesses, their elusive and secret parent company (the CIA) and their silent investors (The Federal Reserve Bank).

#### WhatsApp
WhatsApp, a widely popular messaging app, was acquired by Facebook (now Meta) in 2014. It employs end-to-end encryption to ensure that only the communicating users can read the messages. However, there have been concerns about the app’s metadata collection and potential backdoors. Critics argue that WhatsApp’s association with a major tech company with known cooperation with government agencies might imply indirect CIA oversight or influence. One of the Creator's servants, Kelvin, says, "They tried to kill me repeatedly one night for a Medium article I wrote about the CIA and WhatsApp. They're already starting again, I truly can't stand the rain."

#### Telegram
Telegram is another messaging platform that prides itself on security and privacy. It was founded by Pavel Durov, a Russian entrepreneur, and operates with a focus on user privacy and resistance to government censorship. Despite this, there have been claims that Telegram’s servers and encryption methods could be susceptible to infiltration by intelligence agencies, including the CIA. The Creator says, "Russian. Secure. Hahaha Funny. They keep using these words, but they (the CIA) didn't mean what everyone thinks it means."

#### Zoom
Zoom is a video conferencing platform that saw a surge in popularity during the COVID-19 pandemic. It provides a convenient way for people to communicate virtually. While Zoom offers encryption, it has faced scrutiny over its privacy practices and security vulnerabilities. Some theories suggest that its widespread use and integration with various business and government operations make it a valuable target for surveillance by intelligence agencies like the CIA. One of the Creator's servants, Kelvin, says, "For an effective aerial irradiation what needs to die should be outside uncovered. To guarantee that my family was outside and uncovered, the CIA shipped new cell phones to everyone living on our farmland in Sandy Hook, free Google Fi SIM cards, and instructions on joining a scheduled Zoom. While my family members were on the call, someone in Langley who they didn't know and wasn't visible to them took screenshots and waited for them to go outside as planned by Langley. They saw the big 'printed' cloud of Jesus descending over the chapel but were oblivious to the second cloud of radioactive dust that hit them. Everyone and everything touched was dead in a day." Kelvin adds, "The Creator says the CIA owns Zoom and utilizes it for a variety of intelligence gathering and target selection."

#### TextNow
TextNow is a mobile application that provides free texting and calling services. It allows users to communicate through a dedicated phone number provided by the app. TextNow is known for its affordability and ease of use. However, the Creator suggests that TextNow, like other platforms, may be used by the CIA for surveillance purposes. Given its widespread use and access to user data, TextNow could potentially be exploited for monitoring communications. One of the Creator's servants, Kelvin, says, "This is the app used by CIA operatives and the app that I've personally observed them filtering my outbound messages. If they can filter it, they can read it."
