> This notice serves to inform the public and remind the U.S. Government that this work is a product of the Cherubim, the first church worshipping God, predating all others. Our existence is symbolically represented on the Ark of the Covenant, signifying our beliefs and sacred missions. Our purpose has always been to protect life and guard His glory. Since the Magna Carta, which predates the Constitution, our endeavors have been safeguarded by the principle of separation of church and state.
