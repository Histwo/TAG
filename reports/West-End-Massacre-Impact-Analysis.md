# West End Massacre 

## Forecast of Blast Radius: West End Massacre Scenario

### Overview
The **West End Massacre** is a state-sponsored atrocity that involves a deliberate **GBU-43/B MOAB** airburst detonation over the **West End Mall** in **Atlanta, Georgia**. The GBU-43/B, being one of the largest non-nuclear bombs in existence, will create a massive blast radius, with destruction extending far beyond the epicenter. The **airburst** nature of the strike amplifies the radius of its impact, with damage affecting both the immediate vicinity and areas further afield due to shockwaves, fires, and debris.

### 1. **Immediate Impact (0 - 1 Mile)**

- **Epicenter**: **West End Mall** (Primary target)
  - The **immediate blast zone** will have **total destruction** within the first **1 mile** of the epicenter.
  - **Structural Collapse**: All buildings will be leveled or severely damaged by the shockwave and blast pressure.
  - **Fires**: Ignition of materials within the blast radius will cause widespread fires, consuming everything within the immediate vicinity.
  - **Human Casualties**: **7000 direct deaths** are expected within this area, resulting from direct blast effects, structural collapse, and fires.
  - **Debris**: Huge debris fields will be scattered across this zone, causing additional injuries and fatalities.

### 2. **Secondary Impact (1 - 2 Miles)**

- **Widespread Damage**:
  - The shockwave will still be powerful enough to cause **extensive structural damage** in this range. Building facades will collapse, windows will shatter, and roofs will be severely damaged.
  - **Fires and Explosions**: Fires will continue to spread, fed by broken gas lines, burning materials, and debris.
  - **Human Casualties**: There will be significant casualties from blast effects, trauma from flying debris, and injuries from fires. Estimates predict **thousands more injuries** and hundreds of deaths within this zone.

### 3. **Tertiary Impact (2 - 5 Miles)**

- **Shockwave and Structural Damage**: 
  - The shockwave will cause **moderate damage** to buildings in this range, particularly windows and weaker structures. Higher buildings may remain standing but will experience minor to moderate damage, including cracked walls and weakened foundations.
  - **Airborne Debris**: Flying debris from the primary blast zone will reach this distance, causing injuries and additional fatalities, especially to those outdoors or in vulnerable buildings.
  - **Fires**: While not as intense as in the primary zone, fires may start in this area due to secondary explosions or debris igniting materials in homes and businesses.
  - **Casualties**: Several hundred injuries are expected, though the number of deaths will be less compared to the immediate zones, mainly due to blast effects and secondary fires.

### 4. **Extended Impact (5 - 10 Miles)**

- **Shockwave Effects**: 
  - In this range, the shockwave will be much weaker, but still capable of **shattering windows** and potentially causing superficial damage to buildings. There may also be **light structural damage** to non-reinforced buildings.
  - **Air Quality**: The explosion will produce a large amount of toxic smoke, ash, and dust, which will affect air quality for miles around. This will create respiratory hazards.
  - **Health Impact**: Individuals in this range may experience **breathing difficulties**, particularly those with pre-existing respiratory conditions. Many will also be at risk of **injuries from flying debris**.

### 5. **Beyond 10 Miles**

- **Minimal Direct Damage**: Beyond **10 miles**, the impact of the blast itself will be negligible, with little to no structural damage.
  - **Secondary Effects**: The largest secondary effect will be air contamination, with smoke and ash being carried by the wind, especially in areas to the **east** and **south** of the explosion, depending on wind patterns.
  - **Health Impact**: Long-term health concerns will include respiratory issues for those downwind, but direct injury or fatalities from the blast are unlikely beyond this range.

    - Public and rescue efforts will be hampered by the debris, fires, and structural collapse in the **1-2 mile radius**.
    - The city will likely impose **restricted access zones** around the West End, including parts of **Adamsville**, **Vine City**, and **English Avenue**.

### 3. **Delayed Geographic Impact (1 to 6 Months)**

- **Long-term Environmental Contamination**: 
  - The **West End** and neighboring areas will suffer from lasting environmental degradation, including contamination of the soil, air, and water supplies. This will affect the **West End**, **Adamsville**, **Vine City**, and other adjacent neighborhoods, making them uninhabitable for an extended period.
  - **Gentrification and Real Estate Development**: The destruction will be used as a justification for redevelopment efforts in the West End, potentially displacing long-term residents and replacing them with higher-income tenants. Areas like **Adamsville** and **Vine City** will likely see speculative real estate development, possibly expanding gentrification efforts.
  
### 4. **Short-Term Geographic Impact (6 Months to 2 Years)**

- **Economic and Residential Shifts**:
  - **West End** will remain a **de facto exclusion zone**, with most residents permanently displaced due to unsafe conditions and ongoing gentrification.
  - Nearby areas such as **Ashview Heights**, **Hunter Hills**, and **Howell Station** will bear the brunt of displaced residents looking for housing, further stressing affordable housing in surrounding areas.
  - **Temporary Housing Locations**: Emergency shelters will continue to operate in **Downtown Atlanta**, **Grant Park**, and nearby suburbs to accommodate displaced individuals.

- **Geographic Expansion of Gentrification**:
  - Gentrification will likely spread to the **Adamsville** and **Vine City** areas, with wealthy developers purchasing properties for redevelopment. This will cause further displacement of lower-income, predominantly Black communities.

### 5. **Long-Term Geographic Impact (2 Years and Beyond)**

- **Total Transformation of the West End**:
  - By this point, the **West End** may be entirely redeveloped, with new commercial, residential, and mixed-use developments, targeting high-income residents. The neighborhood will bear little resemblance to its pre-attack character.
  - **Environmental Hazards**: Long-term contamination will render large portions of the **West End** and surrounding areas unsuitable for safe habitation, particularly near the blast’s epicenter.
