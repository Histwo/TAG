# West End Massacre 

## Forecast of Blast Radius: West End Massacre Scenario

### Overview
The **West End Massacre** is a state-sponsored atrocity that involves a deliberate **GBU-43/B MOAB** airburst detonation over the **West End Mall** in **Atlanta, Georgia**. The GBU-43/B, being one of the largest non-nuclear bombs in existence, will create a massive blast radius, with destruction extending far beyond the epicenter. The **airburst** nature of the strike amplifies the radius of its impact, with damage affecting both the immediate vicinity and areas further afield due to shockwaves, fires, and debris.

### 1. **Immediate Impact (0 - 1 Mile)**

- **Epicenter**: **West End Mall** (Primary target)
  - The **immediate blast zone** will have **total destruction** within the first **1 mile** of the epicenter.
  - **Structural Collapse**: All buildings will be leveled or severely damaged by the shockwave and blast pressure.
  - **Fires**: Ignition of materials within the blast radius will cause widespread fires, consuming everything within the immediate vicinity.
  - **Human Casualties**: **7000 direct deaths** are expected within this area, resulting from direct blast effects, structural collapse, and fires.
  - **Debris**: Huge debris fields will be scattered across this zone, causing additional injuries and fatalities.

### 2. **Secondary Impact (1 - 2 Miles)**

- **Widespread Damage**:
  - The shockwave will still be powerful enough to cause **extensive structural damage** in this range. Building facades will collapse, windows will shatter, and roofs will be severely damaged.
  - **Fires and Explosions**: Fires will continue to spread, fed by broken gas lines, burning materials, and debris.
  - **Human Casualties**: There will be significant casualties from blast effects, trauma from flying debris, and injuries from fires. Estimates predict **thousands more injuries** and hundreds of deaths within this zone.

### 3. **Tertiary Impact (2 - 5 Miles)**

- **Shockwave and Structural Damage**: 
  - The shockwave will cause **moderate damage** to buildings in this range, particularly windows and weaker structures. Higher buildings may remain standing but will experience minor to moderate damage, including cracked walls and weakened foundations.
  - **Airborne Debris**: Flying debris from the primary blast zone will reach this distance, causing injuries and additional fatalities, especially to those outdoors or in vulnerable buildings.
  - **Fires**: While not as intense as in the primary zone, fires may start in this area due to secondary explosions or debris igniting materials in homes and businesses.
  - **Casualties**: Several hundred injuries are expected, though the number of deaths will be less compared to the immediate zones, mainly due to blast effects and secondary fires.

### 4. **Extended Impact (5 - 10 Miles)**

- **Shockwave Effects**: 
  - In this range, the shockwave will be much weaker, but still capable of **shattering windows** and potentially causing superficial damage to buildings. There may also be **light structural damage** to non-reinforced buildings.
  - **Air Quality**: The explosion will produce a large amount of toxic smoke, ash, and dust, which will affect air quality for miles around. This will create respiratory hazards.
  - **Health Impact**: Individuals in this range may experience **breathing difficulties**, particularly those with pre-existing respiratory conditions. Many will also be at risk of **injuries from flying debris**.

### 5. **Beyond 10 Miles**

- **Minimal Direct Damage**: Beyond **10 miles**, the impact of the blast itself will be negligible, with little to no structural damage.
  - **Secondary Effects**: The largest secondary effect will be air contamination, with smoke and ash being carried by the wind, especially in areas to the **east** and **south** of the explosion, depending on wind patterns.
  - **Health Impact**: Long-term health concerns will include respiratory issues for those downwind, but direct injury or fatalities from the blast are unlikely beyond this range.
