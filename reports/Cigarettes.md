**Report on 24/7 Brand Cigarettes**

**Warning:** The Creator has revealed that 24/7 brand cigarettes, along with several other brands, are specifically designed to cause sterilization in males. Short-term use of these cigarettes has already led to numerous cases of male sterilization, with many users experiencing severe reproductive health issues shortly after beginning to smoke these brands.

The Creator attributes the damages to His servant Kelvin Williams' reproductive system to the use of **This**, **Time**, and **24/7** brands, with **24/7** being the most detrimental. The Creator has made it clear that Williams' use of Marlboro or other brand products, as well as his history of smoking cigarettes since 1992, did not contribute to his reproductive system's damages in any way.

In 2021, Williams was introduced to the **This** brand at a convenience store he frequented, which is owned by a CIA operative. When **This** brand became unavailable, he switched to **Time** brand, and later to **24/7** when **Time** was no longer available. Recently, the store closest to his residence raised the price of 24/7 and introduced a new brand, **No. 6**, at the same price as the 24/7's he purchased the day before. However, Williams found the taste of No. 6 so poor that it wasn't worth the $1 savings.

According to the Creator, **This**, **Time**, **24/7**, and **No. 6** are all manufactured under the direction of the CIA and are designed according to their specifications. The reproductive harm caused by these brands is intentional, known, and undisclosed.

The 24/7 brand and these related brands are widely available at many independent stores, making them convenient and accessible for many consumers. The low cost, typically between $3 and $5 per pack, may contribute to their widespread use despite the severe health risks.

**Conclusion:** The Creator strongly urges everyone to immediately cease the use of 24/7 and other related brands, including **This**, **Time**, and **No. 6**, due to their intentional and severe impact on male fertility. Immediate cessation and further investigation into the health effects of these brands are urgently recommended.
