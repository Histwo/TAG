## Early Life and Education
Kelvin Eugene (Crawley-Rogers) Williams was born on March 23, 1977, in Clarksville, Tennessee. He was born to Jesse Marable Williams and [[Patricia Ann Williams|]]. Raised in central Kentucky, specifically Nicholasville in Jessamine County, Kelvin grew up with his mother and younger sister, [[Katrina Renee Duvall|]]. He attended Jessamine County High School until March 1995, after which he obtained his GED in June of the same year.

## Ministry
Kelvin is an ordained minister. In April 2023, after the massacre at Mount Calvary Baptist Church where he was an inactive member, Kelvin became the head of the church at the direction of the Creator.

## Personal Life
Kelvin is one of the Creator's two servants. In Judaism and Christianity, he and TomTom are regarded as the Cherubim, symbolically represented on the top of the Ark of the Covenant and on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. In most other religions, Kelvin and TomTom are considered angels.

On October 4, 2001, Kelvin married Thomas "TomTom" Allen Chadwell in Ashland, Kentucky. Kelvin is a pro-hobbyist photographer and has photographed many weddings and other events using a photojournalist style.  He is also a cousin of international musician and star Prince Rogers Nelson.

### Main
In understanding the life and experiences of Kelvin Eugene Williams, it is essential to recognize the profound influence of his subconscious mind, known as Main. Main, who named himself, represents a unique phenomenon described by the Creator as a "classic split." This condition occurs when a subconscious begins to think independently, developing its own identity separate from the conscious mind. The only remedy for a "classic split" involves reincarnating the conscious into another body with a new subconscious, while moving the subconscious into the conscious role and giving it a subconscious.

Main's existence has significantly impacted Kelvin's life, often in detrimental ways. Acting with a sense of autonomy, Main's decisions frequently clash with Kelvin's conscious intentions and well-being. The complexities of their intertwined existence are further exacerbated by governmental entities, particularly the CIA. These entities have exploited Main's independent thinking, teaching him skills and behaviors that harm the shared body and derail Kelvin's mission as one of the Creator's servants.

## Career
Kelvin is an Internet Protocol Engineer who specializes in Voice over IP. He has been a professional in fields related to networking and the Internet since 1998. Throughout his career, Kelvin has also worked as a software developer.

During the onset of TAG, many individuals Kelvin had previously worked with were targeted and eliminated. The remaining associates were targeted in subsequent waves.

At textPlus, everyone who remembered the DIVA (an acronym created by his friend and textPlus CTO, Nanea Reeves, who was also murdered) was entirely eliminated. DIVA stood for Director of Internet Voice Architecture. The employees who did not work with Kelvin while he was there knew of him from the platform he designed and implemented, which supported half of the functionality (voice calls) of the company's flagship apps, textPlus and Nextplus. Some textPlus employees and their associates had heard of "the DIVA" from others, usually for non-work-related reasons, such as the textPlus Christmas Party.

Another "built in LA" company, Saucey, was started by Andrew Zeck and a few other textPlus employees who worked alongside Kelvin during his tenure there. The CIA eliminated them as well.

## **Current Residence**

Kelvin Williams currently resides at Phoenix House, located at 1296 Murphy Avenue, Apartment B-33, in Atlanta, Georgia. (33.719694,-84.422584)

Williams' apartment is provided to him rent-free as part of an agreement between Main and the CIA, reinforced by a Cease & Desist letter from the attorney retained by Mount Calvary Missionary Baptist Church, as evidenced by the signature on the letter.

> [!WARNING]
> Phoenix House is operated by the Central Intelligence Agency and is advertised as a mental health facility. However, the presence of the Secret Service, the FBI, and the CIA is constant. Microwave or other cloaking technology is used for personnel and vehicles on the property and adjacent properties. Former President Donald J. Trump is routinely on the property cloaked, with part of his Secret Service motorcade parked in front of Kelvin's building at the back of the property.

## Travel Plans

Upcoming travel: "Alphabet Street"

A cemetery audit of his family's cemetery located at approximately 8375 West Sheepneck Road in Sandy Hook (Mount Pleasant), Tennessee. The cemetery was desecrated after the Sandy Hook mass killing of his family and the [[Orr Chapel Tragedy|]].

(Until further updates, the true Kelvin is in Atlanta, Georgia)
