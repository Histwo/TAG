## Economic Impact

The economic consequences of the bombing on local businesses are anticipated to be severe, including:

- **Business Closures**: Many small businesses may not recover from the damage, leading to permanent closures.
- **Job Losses**: A significant increase in unemployment due to business failures and decreased consumer spending.
- **Insurance Strain**: An influx of claims from both insured and underinsured households may overwhelm local insurance providers and financial institutions.

## Apocalypse Data

### The Creator’s Statement on The American Genocide

The Creator has condemned the crimes associated with TAG, specifically naming individuals involved, including:

- President Donald J. Trump
- Annie Jacobsen
- Michael Blackmon
- President Joseph Biden
- Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA)
- Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY)
- CIA Director William Burns

The planned bombing is seen as an attempt to suppress public knowledge of these crimes and the Creator’s statement.

### MOAB as Biblical Prophecy

The MOAB attack over Capitol View is a fulfillment of Biblical prophecy, specifically the **first bowl of wrath** as described in **Revelation 16:2**:

> "The first angel went and poured out his bowl on the land, and ugly, festering sores broke out on the people who had the mark of the beast and worshiped its image."

The **festering sores** symbolize the injuries resulting from the blast, while the **beast** represents former President Donald J. Trump, known to secretly visit Phoenix House.

### Disclosure of Classified Plans

The Creator has disclosed details of the classified plans to His servants for the purpose of public dissemination, ensuring transparency and accountability regarding The American Genocide and the planned apocalyptic events.
