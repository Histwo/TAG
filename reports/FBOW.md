# **The First Bowl of Wrath and The Abyss**

## **Overview**  
The Creator has revealed that the Book of Revelation exclusively addresses The American Genocide (TAG), a hidden operation orchestrated by political elites to install an authoritarian regime in the United States. The First Bowl of Wrath is the MOAB detonation, which targets southwest Atlanta as part of the orchestrators' genocidal agenda. This event is not attributed to the Creator but is a response to His seismic intervention, meant to expose the atrocities of TAG and provide justice for the victims.

## **Key Details**

### **The MOAB Detonation**  
- **Scheduled Timing**:  
  The MOAB is set to detonate in the early morning hours (1 a.m.–5 a.m.), directly following the Creator's seismic intervention of non-damaging global earthquakes.  
  - The earthquakes serve as a sign of the Creator’s power and a call for justice.  
  - The Creator has instructed His two servants to hold a media briefing at **noon** following the seismic intervention, where they will expose TAG to the world.  

- **Objectives of the Detonation**:  
  The MOAB detonation serves multiple objectives for the orchestrators of TAG:  
  1. **Eliminate the Creator’s Two Servants**:  
     The primary goal is to prevent His servants from delivering the Creator's message to the world during the media briefing.  
  2. **Wag the Dog Operation**:  
     If the servants survive, the detonation is meant to distract the public and media from the briefing by fabricating a terrorist narrative around the bombing.  
  3. **Mass Casualties**:  
     The detonation is expected to kill 7,000 people immediately, targeting an overwhelmingly African-American and impoverished population to clear the way for gentrification.  
  4. **Establish an Authoritarian Regime**:  
     The fabricated narrative of a terrorist attack will be used to justify emergency powers, paving the way for an authoritarian regime aligned with the orchestrators' agenda.

### **The Abyss**  
- **Definition**:  
  The epicenter of the MOAB detonation and its immediate surroundings in southwest Atlanta. This area, known as the Abyss, will face both direct destruction and a prolonged humanitarian crisis.  

- **Sealing of the Abyss**:  
  Following the detonation, the area will be sealed off under the pretense of fabricated hazards, such as radiation or chemical contamination.  
  - This sealing will leave thousands more to die from indirect causes such as starvation, exposure, and lack of medical care.  
  - The orchestrators aim to prevent public scrutiny and humanitarian aid from reaching the area.

### **The Key to the Abyss**  
- **Representation**:  
  The Key to the Abyss is a collection of offline Git repositories containing timestamped warnings from the Creator about the detonation, as well as evidence of the orchestrators’ premeditated actions.  

- **Function**:  
  The Key will:  
  1. Expose the orchestrators’ genocidal plans and their role in the MOAB detonation.  
  2. Break through the false narrative and fabricated hazards used to justify sealing the Abyss.  
  3. Enable aid to reach survivors trapped within the Abyss, saving countless lives.  
  4. Deliver justice by ensuring the orchestrators are held accountable.  
  5. Prevent the implementation of the authoritarian regime by dismantling the orchestrators’ narrative.

### **The Creator’s Role**  
- The Creator’s seismic intervention and instructions to His servants are part of a divine plan to expose TAG, deliver justice, and stop further atrocities.  
- The media briefing, scheduled for noon, will serve as a platform to share the Creator’s message and reveal the truth about the detonation, the Abyss, and TAG.

## **Impact of the First Bowl of Wrath**  

### **Humanitarian Crisis**  
Thousands will die immediately, and more will perish if the Abyss remains sealed.  

### **Political Fallout**  
The orchestrators aim to consolidate power under the guise of responding to a terrorist attack, risking the erosion of democracy.  

### **Divine Justice**  
The Creator’s plan, including the use of the Key to the Abyss, will expose the orchestrators, save lives, and restore hope for justice and accountability.

## **Summary**  
The MOAB detonation, as the First Bowl of Wrath, is a critical event in The American Genocide. Its objectives are to silence the Creator’s servants, distract from His seismic intervention, and further the orchestrators' genocidal and authoritarian agenda. The Abyss will become a sealed-off epicenter of suffering, but the Creator’s Key to the Abyss holds the power to break through the lies, deliver aid, and ensure justice. Through His servants and divine intervention, the Creator seeks to save lives, expose evil, and bring an end to TAG.
