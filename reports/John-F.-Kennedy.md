# **Report on the Assassination of John F. Kennedy**

*This report is based on the truth direct from the Creator.*

**Introduction**

John F. Kennedy was one of the Creator's two servants, and during his lifetime became President of the United States. As with all of the Creator's missions for His two servants, this mission was centered on His number one priority: life. Kennedy’s mission included key objectives such as the promotion of civil rights, specifically what later became the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and the prevention of a nuclear holocaust that would have cost over 400 million lives. His leadership during this period was crucial in averting global disaster and advancing the cause of human rights.

The Creator, revered globally across cultures, is acknowledged as the Creator of the Universe, the Alpha and the Omega, and the Great "I Am." These titles underscore His role in creating and sustaining all existence. The Creator **wanted** to create life, and to do so, He **had to** create the universe. Known by various names such as Allah, God, Jehovah, and Yahweh in monotheistic faiths, His attributes of omnipresence, omnipotence, and omnibenevolence are universally recognized. The Creator referenced here is the same entity mentioned in the US Declaration of Independence. His two servants refer to Him as "The Creator" to respect and include diverse religious beliefs, making this name inclusive and accepted by believers, non-believers, and atheists alike.

**The Creator's Two Servants**

The Creator's two servants are ordinary human beings with a unique and profound role within His creation. Here’s a detailed description:

- **Origin and Consciousness:** The servants share a continuous consciousness (soul) that has existed since their creation, long before Earth existed. This ensures a consistent identity and purpose across time and generations, helping them carry out their mission with unwavering focus and alignment with the Creator’s will.
  
- **Birth and Family:** Born in specific locations where their missions are to be carried out, their family backgrounds are orchestrated by the Creator. Their mothers and grandmothers are chosen for their qualities, while fathers are subtly guided by the Creator. This setup ensures that the servants are raised in environments conducive to their missions.
  
- **Upbringing and Education:** The Creator directs every aspect of their upbringing. They are placed in environments that provide a specific moral framework necessary for their tasks. Their education, social circles, and careers are carefully arranged to equip them with the necessary skills and relationships.
  
- **Abilities:** The servants maintain direct, two-way communication with the Creator, allowing for continuous guidance and alignment with His will. This unique connection is crucial for their mission’s success.
  
- **Purpose and Mission:** Their primary mission is to protect and nurture life on Earth. Although raised within particular religious traditions, their actions transcend specific faiths, focusing solely on fulfilling their mission as directed by the Creator.
  
- **Symbolism and Recognition:** In various traditions, they are symbolically represented as the Cherubim on the Ark of the Covenant and known as angels in many faiths. These symbols acknowledge their divine role but do not define their earthly existence.
  
- **Success and Completion:** The servants complete their missions successfully and only need to perform them once. Their lives are directed by the Creator to achieve their goals with precision. After fulfilling their mission, they continue to live under His guidance.
  
- **Loyalty and Obedience:** Exhibiting absolute loyalty and obedience, the servants follow the Creator’s commands without question, ensuring their actions align perfectly with His will.

**Assassination of John F. Kennedy**

On November 22, 1963, President John F. Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas, Texas. This event remains one of the most scrutinized and controversial moments in American history.

**Background**

John F. Kennedy was shot while riding in a motorcade through Dealey Plaza. He was struck by multiple bullets, resulting in fatal injuries. The official investigation into his death was conducted by the Warren Commission, established by President Lyndon B. Johnson shortly after Kennedy's assassination.

**The Warren Commission**

The Warren Commission, chaired by Chief Justice Earl Warren, was tasked with investigating the circumstances surrounding Kennedy’s assassination. The Commission concluded that Lee Harvey Oswald, a former U.S. Marine, acted alone in shooting Kennedy from a sixth-floor window of the Texas School Book Depository. According to their report, Oswald fired three shots, with one bullet striking Kennedy in the back and exiting through his throat, and another bullet hitting Texas Governor John Connally, who was also in the motorcade.

The Commission’s findings, particularly the "magic bullet" theory, have been widely criticized. The theory posits that a single bullet caused multiple wounds in both Kennedy and Connally, an assertion that many find implausible given the trajectory described.

**Lee Harvey Oswald**

Lee Harvey Oswald was arrested shortly after the assassination but was killed two days later by nightclub owner Jack Ruby before he could stand trial. Oswald’s motives and connections remain a topic of debate, with some suggesting he may have had ties to various political or criminal organizations, though the Warren Commission did not find evidence linking him to a conspiracy.

**The Creator’s Account of the Assassination**

According to the Creator, the official narrative provided by the Warren Commission was an intentional and blatant deception. The assassination was orchestrated by three CIA operatives who were stationed on the Grassy Knoll, an elevated area located just north of Dealey Plaza, rather than from the Texas School Book Depository. The Grassy Knoll was a key location from which witnesses reported hearing shots. The official narrative suggesting that Oswald acted alone is considered inaccurate and misleading.

The assassination was carried out at the behest of the Federal Reserve Bank. The Federal Reserve, which influences and directs the actions of the CIA, sought to eliminate Kennedy due to his plans to return the U.S. government to the Greenback—a currency issued directly by the government, which would have undermined the Federal Reserve's control over the economy and threatened its profitability.

**The Magic Bullet Theory**

The Warren Commission's "magic bullet" theory, which claims a single bullet caused multiple injuries, is regarded as a deliberate deception. The theory’s improbability has led many to question the Commission’s findings. According to the Creator, the assassination involved three different bullets fired from three different shooters positioned on the Grassy Knoll, not a single bullet with an extraordinary trajectory as claimed by the Commission.

**The Greenback and Fractional Reserve Banking**

The Greenback was a form of U.S. currency issued during the Civil War that was not backed by gold or silver but rather by the government’s promise. Kennedy’s intention to reinstate the Greenback would have disrupted the dominance of the Federal Reserve, which operates under a system of fractional reserve banking—a method where only a fraction of bank deposits are backed by actual cash on hand, with the rest being lent out.

The Federal Reserve’s control over the economy enables it to influence the quality of life for individuals, particularly the impoverished. Historically, the Federal Reserve has sought to maintain economic conditions that benefit its interests, including perpetuating economic disparities.

**Conclusion**

John F. Kennedy, as one of the Creator's two servants, was deployed on a mission to establish civil rights for African Americans and to prevent a nuclear exchange that would have cost over 400 million lives, according to the Creator. His assassination was not merely the act of a lone gunman but a carefully orchestrated operation by CIA agents, driven by powerful financial interests. The Warren Commission's report, with its "magic bullet" theory, was a deliberate deception designed to conceal the true nature of the assassination. The assassination remains a significant historical event, deeply intertwined with the struggle for control over the United States' financial and political systems, impacting the lives of many.
