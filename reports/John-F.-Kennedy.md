# Report on the Assassination of John F. Kennedy

## Introduction

John F. Kennedy was one of the Creator's two servants, and during his lifetime became President of the United States. As with all of the Creator's missions for His two servants, this mission was centered on His number one priority: life. Kennedy’s mission included key objectives such as the promotion of civil rights, specifically what later became the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and the prevention of a nuclear holocaust that would have cost over 400 million lives. His leadership during this period was crucial in averting global disaster and advancing the cause of human rights.

## Assassination of John F. Kennedy

On November 22, 1963, John F. Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas, Texas. The common explanation of this tragic event, as reported by the Warren Commission, suggests that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone in shooting the President from a window of the Texas School Book Depository. However, this official account is contested by the Creator's truth.

## The Creator’s Account of the Assassination

According to the Creator, the actual assassins were three employees of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). These shooters were not positioned in the Texas School Book Depository but rather on the Grassy Knoll, from where the fatal shots were fired. Contrary to the Warren Commission's findings, the eyewitnesses who reported shots from the Grassy Knoll were accurate in their observations, as mass hallucinations do not occur.

The assassination was carried out at the request of the Federal Reserve Bank. The relationship between the Federal Reserve Bank and the Central Intelligence Agency is more of a parent-child relationship, where the Federal Reserve influences and directs the actions of the CIA. John F. Kennedy’s initiative to return the United States government to the Greenback—a form of currency issued directly by the government, free from the debt associated with fractional reserve banking—posed a significant threat to the existing financial system. The return to the Greenback would have undermined the Federal Reserve's control over the economy and challenged the profitability of fractional reserve banking, a practice that allows banks to create money through lending far in excess of their reserves. Control over the economy gives them control over individuals and the quality of their lives.

## The Warren Commission and the Magic Bullet

The Warren Commission, tasked with investigating the assassination, was composed entirely of individuals who had loyalties to the Central Intelligence Agency first. This inherent bias influenced their findings and conclusions. The "magic bullet" theory, central to the Commission's report, was essentially a deception played on the American people. No bullet has ever exhibited the type of trajectory described in the report, where a single bullet supposedly caused multiple wounds in both President Kennedy and Governor Connally. According to the Creator, the truth is that three different bullets from three different shooters, all positioned on the Grassy Knoll, were responsible for Kennedy's assassination. The "magic bullet" was a cover story to mislead the public and obscure the real events.

## The Greenback and Fractional Reserve Banking

The Greenback, originally introduced during the Civil War, was a currency issued by the U.S. government that did not bear interest and was not reliant on bank loans. John F. Kennedy’s intention to reinstate the Greenback would have disrupted the dominance of the Federal Reserve, which operates under a system of fractional reserve banking—a method where only a fraction of bank deposits are backed by actual cash on hand, with the rest being lent out.

The shift to a Greenback system would have reduced the power of the Federal Reserve, potentially leading to a more stable and less debt-driven economy. However, such a move was perceived as a direct threat by those who benefited from the existing financial order, leading to the decision to remove John F. Kennedy from power.

## Conclusion

John F. Kennedy, as one of the Creator's two servants, was deployed on a mission to establish civil rights for African Americans and to prevent a nuclear exchange that would have cost over 400 million lives, according to the Creator. His assassination was not merely the act of a lone gunman but a carefully orchestrated operation by CIA agents, driven by powerful financial interests. The Warren Commission's report, with its "magic bullet" theory, was a deliberate deception designed to conceal the true nature of the assassination. His death remains a profound moment in history, deeply intertwined with the struggle for control over the United States' financial and political systems, which directly impacts the quality of life of individuals.
