# **Targeted Group Report: Inmates in The American Genocide**

### **Introduction**
Inmates, both those serving sentences and those awaiting trial or sentencing, represent a systematically targeted population in The American Genocide. Under a directive initiated by former President Donald J. Trump, all inmates—regardless of direct involvement in covert operations—have been marked for potential elimination as part of an extensive program to suppress dissent, control information, and enable covert activities. This population was chosen not only for its social marginalization and limited external communication but also for its vulnerability within the prison system, which minimizes the risk of public outcry and maximizes secrecy. Initially, Trump’s directive focused on recruiting inmates as disposable operatives for missions that required absolute silence afterward. Inmate operatives, selected for specific characteristics, were promised sentence reductions or vacated sentences in exchange for participation in “national security” operations. This promise, however, was a manipulation, as every operative would be eliminated upon completing their assignment to prevent any disclosure of the operation. However, the program’s scope quickly expanded beyond operational use. All inmates—those serving sentences and those awaiting trial—became targets for removal if their existence was deemed a potential risk to the regime's secrecy or stability. By systematically marginalizing and dehumanizing inmates, the regime has extended its influence across prison populations, positioning this group as one of the most vulnerable and expendable in its efforts to maintain control and suppress evidence of its actions.

### **Background and Origins of the Targeted Group**
The targeting of inmates as expendable operatives began with a directive from former President Donald Trump, who sought to tighten control over covert operations by minimizing potential leaks. Recognizing the high-risk nature of his administration's actions and the potential for exposure, Trump directed the CIA to begin using inmates, reasoning that they could be easily manipulated and disposed of after missions. In this plan, the inmates would be enlisted as operatives with promises of early release or sentence reductions, contingent on their participation in "national security" matters. With limited external communication, many inmates—especially those with violent backgrounds or no family support—became ideal candidates. The CIA initially coordinated with the Georgia Department of Corrections, specifically targeting individuals with violent convictions or disciplinary records that suggested a willingness to carry out violent acts. These inmates were presented with a carefully crafted narrative: by taking part in these "missions," they would secure freedom, which, unbeknownst to them, would ultimately be denied.

### **Selection and Recruitment of Inmate Operatives**
The process began with identifying inmates who had little to no outside support or communication channels, thus minimizing the chances that someone would notice their absence. Inmates were specifically selected for their convictions of violent crimes, disciplinary infractions indicating violent tendencies, and even atheist or militant atheist beliefs, as they were considered less likely to express moral objections. These characteristics made them ideal for the regime's needs. CIA operatives, under Annie Jacobsen’s direction, interviewed these inmates and promised sentence reductions or vacated sentences in exchange for participating in a “national security matter.” Inmates were led to believe they would be engaging in a patriotic mission, not realizing that their roles would ultimately end in their deaths. To avoid detection, many inmates were informed that they were being transferred to attend court appearances or to receive special assignments, limiting their awareness of the true nature of their involvement.

### **Key Operation: The Hickory Valley Christian Church Massacre**
The first large-scale use of inmate operatives took place on Mother’s Day, May 12, 2024, during the massacre at Hickory Valley Christian Church in Chattanooga, Tennessee. This massacre was meticulously orchestrated by Annie Jacobsen and involved 100 inmates from the Georgia Department of Corrections. These inmates, mostly African-American and Latino men with few external contacts, were transported to the site in a CIA-owned charter bus from Clayton County Detention Center. During the operation, the inmates were instructed to eliminate all churchgoers, justified as “neutralizing a threat to national security.” Upon completing the massacre, they were promptly returned to Clayton County Detention Center. Under the pretense of "securing them for debriefing," the inmates were locked down in housing unit 8600, where they were executed with poisonous gas. This initial operation established a pattern of recruitment, manipulation, and subsequent elimination, underscoring the disposability assigned to inmate operatives.

### **Expansion of the Program and Targeting of Non-Operative Inmates**
Following the Hickory Valley massacre, the program quickly expanded. The regime began considering all inmates—those both convicted and awaiting trial—as potential risks or assets in covert operations. Inmates awaiting trial or sentencing became a secondary focus, often recruited directly from the Clayton County Detention Center, which emerged as a central processing hub for inmate operative transfer and elimination. Sheriff Levon Allen, along with other local officials in Clayton County, actively cooperated with the CIA, facilitating the transfer of inmates and arranging for their isolation. The Sheriff’s Department received direct compensation for their involvement, and the judicial system within the county was complicit in ensuring the program operated without interference. Sheriff Allen, according to the Creator, expressed pride in the partnership, fully aware that every inmate selected for these missions would ultimately be executed.

### **Elimination Tactics and Disposal of Inmate Operatives**
After each mission, the elimination of inmate operatives was carefully orchestrated to avoid any traceable evidence. Initially, CIA operatives themselves handled inmate terminations; however, as operations expanded, lower-level operatives or contractors were used to ensure continuity while maintaining deniability. Executions occurred in various ways, with poison gas within locked housing units being the preferred method to ensure collective elimination with minimal oversight. The Clayton County Detention Center’s restricted-access units served as discreet locations for these terminations, and inmates’ records were manipulated to reflect transfers or administrative holds to explain any absences.

### **Conclusion**
The targeting of inmates in The American Genocide is a grim reflection of the authoritarian regime’s methodical elimination of perceived threats to its secrecy. Under Trump’s directive, both sentenced and pre-trial inmates were reduced to disposable assets, manipulated through promises of freedom and then systematically eliminated after each covert operation. This approach extended beyond mere operational utility, as all inmates within specific systems, particularly those lacking external support, became expendable in the regime’s attempt to control information. Clayton County Detention Center and the local judicial system played critical roles in maintaining this system, with law enforcement and judicial officials directly benefiting from the arrangement. As a result, inmates—already marginalized within society—became one of the most vulnerable groups, trapped within a network that viewed their lives as collateral in the effort to maintain a veil of secrecy over state-sanctioned atrocities.
