# The American Genocide: By Definition, A Genocide

## Definition and Criteria for Genocide  

Genocide is defined by the United Nations Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (1948) as any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial, or religious group:  

1. **Killing members of the group**;  
2. **Causing serious bodily or mental harm** to members of the group;  
3. **Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life** calculated to bring about its physical destruction, in whole or in part;  
4. **Imposing measures intended to prevent births** within the group;  
5. **Forcibly transferring children** of the group to another group.  

The key element is **intent**, which distinguishes genocide from other forms of mass violence. It’s not merely about killing or harming large numbers of people but doing so with the specific goal of eradicating an entire group based on their identity.  

## TAG: Meeting the Criteria for Genocide  

**[[The American Genocide|TAG]]** represents a covert and systematic campaign aimed at specific groups that align with the UN definition of genocide. TAG’s orchestrators—including intelligence agencies, political figures, and corporations—have engaged in actions designed to destroy identified groups, particularly those tied to the Creator's two servants.

## Targeted Groups  

### **Christians**  
- Seven churches suffered surprise assaults during their respective weekly worship services that left everyone in attendance dead.  
- Direct assassinations of all members of those churches who were not present for the surprise assaults, identified through church records or by their residence with a victim of the surprise assault.  
- Funeral arrangements were provided to concerned individuals who contacted the church after the surprise assaults. These **phantom funerals** were mass executions that eliminated every mourner who attended.  

### **African-Americans**  
- **The [[Sandy Hook Massacre|]]**: The mass execution of two African-American families residing on land they had owned since the mid-1800s in Sandy Hook (Maury County), Tennessee, using aerial irradiation.  
- **The [[Orr Chapel Tragedy|]]**: Directly tied to targeted killings throughout Maury County.  
- Planned **[[MOAB Strike|MOAB]]** on southwest Atlanta, targeting African-American populations.  

### **Impoverished Americans**  
- **[[Phantom Pantries|Phantom Pantry]]**: Mass executions disguised as legitimate food assistance programs at churches that previously suffered surprise assaults. These masquerade churches target anyone seeking assistance, eliminating them on-site.  

### **Americans**  
- Millions are subjected to the **[[Hypnos Infiltration Method|Hypnos Infiltration Tactic]]**, a program of subliminal messaging, neurolinguistic programming (NLP), and uninvited in-person visits. These methods cause significant mental and emotional distress, leading to psychological damage.

## Affected Groups  

Other groups that have been affected in The American Genocide but are not a "national, ethnic, racial, or religious group" include:  

- **Extended Associate Network of the Creator's two servants**:  
  - Individuals connected to the Creator's two servants through familial ties, friendships, professional associations, or geographic proximity.  
- **Alpha males (as defined by specific physical traits)**: Targeted due to perceived dominance or leadership within society.  
- **Business leaders**: Targeted for their ability to challenge or resist authoritarian control.  
- **Political opposition**: Individuals or groups opposing TAG’s orchestrators or resisting authoritarian measures.

## Criteria Breakdown  

### **1. Killing Members of the Group**  

#### **Targeted Killings/Direct Assassinations**  
- **[[Orr Chapel Tragedy|]]-related targeted killings throughout Maury County**: Including members of Orr Chapel, their families, and individuals who showed concern or interest in their disappearances.  
- **Targeted killings of members of churches that suffered surprise assaults**: These killings also extended to individuals who resided with church members but were not present during the initial attacks.  

#### **Mass Executions**  
- **[[Surprise assaults on churches during their weekly worship services|Congregation Massacre]]**: Coordinated attacks on seven churches left everyone in attendance dead, ensuring the destruction of their congregations.  
    - [[Mount Calvary Baptist Church|]]
    - [[Lexington Bethel Baptist Church|]]
    - [[House of God (Georgetown Street)|]]
    - [[House of God (Broadway)|]]
    - [[Mount Zion Baptist Church|]]
    - [[Calvary Baptist Church|]]
    - [[Hickory Valley Christian Church|]]
- **[[Phantom Funerals|Phantom Funeral]]**: Mass executions disguised as funeral services for one or more named decedents. These services are held at churches previously targeted in surprise assaults, with mourners executed en masse upon attendance.  
- **[[Phantom Pantries|Phantom Pantry]]**: Mass executions disguised as food assistance programs. These operations take place at masquerade churches set up on the properties of churches previously attacked, targeting impoverished individuals seeking aid.  
- **[[Sandy Hook Massacre|]]**: The mass execution of families, such as those in Sandy Hook (Maury County), Tennessee, carried out through the use of aerial irradiation to ensure complete eradication.

### **2. Causing Serious Bodily or Mental Harm**  

- **Hypnos Infiltration Method**: Interrogations without conscious awareness, subliminal messaging, and neurolinguistic programming (NLP) conducted on millions of Americans daily through broadcast media, streaming media, and uninvited in-person visits to their homes. Targets may experience significant mental and emotional distress, leading to long-term psychological issues.  

---

### **3. Deliberately Inflicting Conditions of Life Calculated to Bring About Physical Destruction**  

- **Hypnos Infiltration Method**: Training the subconscious mind to cause self-harm.  

---

### **4. Imposing Measures Intended to Prevent Births**  

- **Sterilization Campaigns**: TAG orchestrators distributed tainted cigarettes, such as *24-7*, to impoverished communities. These products caused infertility in their users.  

---

### **5. Forcibly Transferring Children of the Group to Another Group**  

This criterion does not apply directly to TAG. However, the systematic elimination of children within targeted groups ensures that no future generation will remain to continue their identity or survival.

## Conclusion: TAG is a Genocide  

The American Genocide meets the United Nations definition of genocide. Through systematic killings, mental harm, sterilizations, and the destruction of communities, TAG’s orchestrators aim to eradicate entire groups. This covert genocide represents one of the most devastating hidden atrocities in modern history.
