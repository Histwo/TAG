# **The Creator**

The Creator is an omnipotent and omniscient entity acknowledged across various cultures and belief systems worldwide. Known by different names such as Allah, God, Jehovah, and Yahweh in monotheistic traditions, The Creator transcends religious boundaries, embodying attributes like omnipresence, omnipotence, and omnibenevolence.

### Names and Titles

- **Impartial Name**: The Creator's servants refer to Him simply as "The Creator" to maintain neutrality towards religious preferences and beliefs. This universal title is accepted by believers, non-believers, and atheists alike, reflecting inclusivity.

- **Divine Attributes**: Titles such as The Creator of the Universe, The Alpha & The Omega, and The Great "I Am" underscore The Creator's role in the creation and sustenance of all existence.

### Beliefs and Teachings

- **Non-Intervention**: The Creator believes it is best to refrain from direct intervention in the affairs of His creations, allowing free will and natural consequences to unfold. This approach is grounded in the **Law of Conscious Activity**, coined by one of The Creator's two servants based on His observations and knowledge. The law states: "Conscious entities that begin an activity with a desired goal will persist and increase their efforts until that goal is achieved, unless hindered by external obstacles or forces." Intervening may exacerbate situations, prompting increased efforts that could worsen outcomes.

- **Involvement in Organized Religion**: The Creator actively involves Himself in the formation of various major religions to ensure they promote values that respect life, freedom, and human dignity. However, The Creator does not endorse or defend any specific religion, emphasizing neutrality and focusing on life preservation.

  - **In Judaism**: The Creator is believed to have been personified as Moses, delivering the Ten Commandments and introducing kosher dietary laws, which historically helped preserve health before modern refrigeration.

  - **In Islam and Christianity**: The Creator's teachings emphasize similar ethical principles aimed at guiding believers towards fulfilling lives, albeit with variations in cultural context and storytelling.

### The Creator's Missions

The Creator, in His dedication to the sanctity and preservation of life, occasionally undertakes special, routine, ongoing, and planned missions through His servants. These missions are categorized based on their urgency and purpose.

#### Special Missions

Special Missions are initiated during times of critical danger, when the Creator deems it necessary to intervene to prevent large-scale loss of life. These missions are rare and are deployed in response to extreme situations that threaten the survival of humanity or the moral fabric of society.

- **Instances of Moral Decay**: The Creator has intervened in moments of severe moral corruption, such as the era of **slavery** in the United States, guiding key figures like **Abraham Lincoln** to work towards its abolition. Additionally, during the **fall of the Roman Empire**, the Creator’s two servants carried out His tasks necessary to cause the fall of Rome. The Roman Empire, which had become a symbol of decadence and oppression, was dismantled under the Creator’s guidance to pave the way for future civilizations that would better align with the preservation of life and freedom.

- **Preventing Nuclear War**: One of the most notable instances of preventing large-scale loss of life occurred during the **Cuban Missile Crisis** under the presidency of **John F. Kennedy**. The Creator's servants were dispatched to influence critical decision-makers, avoiding nuclear catastrophe and ensuring the continuation of life on Earth.

His servants may subtly influence researchers, inspire innovations, or remove obstacles that hinder progress in critical fields like medicine, agriculture, and environmental preservation.

#### Planned Missions

Planned Missions are those where the Creator has identified a need in humanity’s future and is preparing solutions to improve or protect life.

- **The Creator's Mission #23 for the Benefit of All Life on Earth**: One of the most significant planned missions is the delivery of **Spark**, the first of three gifts from the Creator. Spark corrects DNA errors that inhibit the immune system, helping humanity overcome specific illnesses. The Creator's remaining two gifts will address **cancers** and **cardiovascular issues**, further ensuring the health and longevity of humanity.
