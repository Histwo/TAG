**Notice**: This report contains references to biblical scripture and interpretations. It is intended for public distribution.

**Introduction**

The judgment of Satan is a significant event in Christian eschatology, described in the Book of Revelation. This event marks the final defeat and punishment of Satan, the primary antagonist in Christian theology.

**Scriptural Reference: Revelation 20:7-10**

*"When the thousand years are completed, Satan will be released from his prison, and will come out to deceive the nations which are in the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together for the war; the number of them is like the sand of the seashore. And they came up on the broad plain of the earth and surrounded the camp of the saints and the beloved city, and fire came down from heaven and devoured them. And the devil who deceived them was thrown into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are also; and they will be tormented day and night forever and ever."* (Revelation 20:7-10, NASB)

**Analysis and Interpretation**

1. **Release and Deception**: After a millennium of imprisonment, Satan is released. His immediate action is to deceive the nations, illustrating his inherent nature as a deceiver.

2. **Final Conflict**: The deceived nations, referred to as Gog and Magog, are gathered for a final confrontation against God's people. This symbolizes the ultimate battle between good and evil.

3. **Divine Intervention**: The battle concludes with divine intervention. Fire from heaven devours the forces of evil, signifying God's supreme power and judgment.

4. **Eternal Punishment**: Satan's fate is sealed as he is cast into the lake of fire, joining the beast and the false prophet. This represents eternal punishment and the ultimate defeat of evil.

**Today's Revelation**

1. **Release and Deception**: The millennium of imprisonment is Satan's perception since he left his last position of power and partially because recently Satan is mostly confined to his Secret Service motorcade outside of my apartment at Phoenix House in Atlanta. Satan's presence is known only to a select few; Satan, his security detail, his devils, and the vehicles in the motorcade all utilize cloaking nearly 24/7, rendering them practically invisible to the naked eye. Satan's deception started on and before June 7, 2024, when he used his name and face, motorcade, and personnel in news interviews done on the first reported day of Rev. Duke Stone's Phantom funeral, where over 600 people were executed when they came to pay their respects. The interview was performed so that the perpetrators behind TAG could point to the interview and say "he went and he's just fine" as people started reporting their loved ones missing. Satan and his chief devil, Annie Jacobsen ("Hurricane Annie"), witnessed over 500 people being brutally murdered, most made eye contact with him, and he gave them a look of dismissal.

2. **Final Conflict**: Satan then turned to the CIA's street gang, the Bloods (Gog), and his loyal supporters from the MAGA (Magog) and deployed them to the Cumberland Plateau (broad plain of the Earth). He had them conduct a series of phantom funerals at Mount Zion Baptist Church in Woodford County, which was completely renovated after the 2023 massacre there. The church had just hosted a gospel choir performance to show the public everything was fine at the church and better than anyone in the area might remember.

3. **Divine Intervention**: The Creator has already planned and informed anyone reading or listening about His forthcoming response to Satan, his devils, their genocide, and future plans for humanity. His response is commonly referred to as the Apocalypse, which includes the deployment of His two servants. The battle concludes with divine intervention. Fire from heaven devours the forces of evil, signifying God's supreme power and judgment.

4. **Eternal Punishment**: Satan's fate is sealed as he is cast into the lake of fire. This location is Phoenix House at 1296 Murphy Avenue in Atlanta, Georgia, 30310. This represents eternal punishment and the ultimate defeat of evil.

**About Satan and His Devils**

Satan has always been a human being. The current office holder is former President Donald J. Trump. Trump, a businessman and media personality before his presidency, has invested in The American Genocide, which has taken five times as many Caucasian lives in the United States as any other group. He is involved in managing this situation in hopes of becoming the U.S.'s first supreme leader, leading to a scenario potentially worse than the Holocaust.

**Conclusion**

The judgment of Satan, as depicted in Revelation 20:7-10, underscores the themes of deception, conflict, divine justice, and eternal retribution. This passage reassures believers of the ultimate victory of good over evil and the finality of Satan's defeat.
