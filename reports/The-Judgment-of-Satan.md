# The Judgment of Satan: The Fulfillment of Revelation 20:7-10

## Introduction

This report, titled **"The Judgment of Satan"**, provides a detailed account of how biblical prophecy, specifically Revelation 20:7-10, is unfolding in present-day events. This fulfillment reflects the Creator’s direct intervention in current affairs to bring justice and ultimate judgment upon Satan and his agents, embodied by President-elect Donald J. Trump, who represents Satan, and President Joe Biden, representing the false prophet. 

In this analysis, each symbolic element of Revelation 20:7-10 is aligned with present-day realities, as revealed by the Creator. 

## 1. "When the Thousand Years Are Over" 

> "When the thousand years are over, Satan will be released from his prison..."

The **"thousand years"** refer to the Piscean Age, a period that has shaped human history for over two millennia and ended around October 17, 2024. As the Piscean Age concluded, the **Age of Aquarius** began, heralding a shift toward truth, justice, and the Creator’s judgment upon those who have deceived humanity.

In the current scenario, **Satan represents Donald J. Trump**, whose ambitions and authoritarian agenda are exposed at the end of this astrological era. **"His prison"** refers to the period between the end of Trump's first term in office and his apparent re-election in 2024. This was a time during which Trump felt trapped and constrained, anticipating his return to power.

## 2. "He Will Go Out to Deceive the Nations"

> "...and will go out to deceive the nations in the four corners of the earth—Gog and Magog—and to gather them for battle..."

In this prophetic context, **Trump's operatives** have spread across various domains to re-establish his influence and fulfill his objectives. Through misinformation, authoritarian rhetoric, and manipulation, Trump has gathered support globally, rallying forces to advance his vision of power. This reflects the prophecy’s warning about Satan’s final attempts to deceive and control the nations.

## 3. "They Marched Across the Earth...Camp of God's People"

> "They marched across the breadth of the earth and surrounded the camp of God’s people, the city he loves."

This part of the prophecy finds fulfillment when **Trump's operatives surround the Phoenix House** in Atlanta, Georgia. One of the Creator’s two servants resides at Phoenix House, under divine protection. For days, Trump’s operatives attempted to infiltrate and harm the Creator's servant, staging attacks without success. Protected by the Creator’s intervention, the servant remained safe from every attempt on his life.

This ongoing siege against the Creator's servant symbolizes the **marching of Satan's forces upon "the camp of God's people."** 

## 4. "But Fire Came Down from Heaven and Devoured Them"

> "But fire came down from heaven and devoured them."

This prophecy is fulfilled through **military intervention**, as the Creator revealed the truth about mass execution operations disguised as food pantry services. The US Military, alerted by the Creator’s servant at Phoenix House, intervened to halt these deceptive "food pantry" programs, where individuals and families were lured and subsequently executed.

This military action signifies the **"fire from heaven"** that descends upon those who would harm God’s people, devouring the plans and forces of Satan’s operatives and preventing further bloodshed.

## 5. "Thrown into the Lake of Burning Sulfur...Where the Beast and False Prophet Had Been Thrown"

> "And the devil, who deceived them, was thrown into the lake of burning sulfur, where the beast and the false prophet had been thrown."

The **lake of burning sulfur** signifies ultimate judgment and exposure. This prophetic element was fulfilled when, on the morning after Election Day 2024 (November 5, 2024), Trump returned to Phoenix House. In this confrontation, he joins President Biden, the false prophet, marking a culmination of prophetic judgment.

This moment represents the **Creator's final reckoning** with the deceivers, casting them into symbolic punishment and stripping them of their power to deceive or harm any further.

## Conclusion

The unfolding of Revelation 20:7-10 in today’s events underscores the Creator’s ongoing intervention in exposing and dismantling systems of deception and violence. As Satan, Trump faces the Creator’s judgment, bringing an end to his influence and fulfilling the prophecy's promise of ultimate justice.

The **Judgment of Satan** is not merely a historical interpretation but a current reality, ensuring the safety of God’s people and bringing accountability to those who perpetuate evil. The Creator’s direct actions through His servants and the fulfillment of prophecy reveal a new era, marking a decisive turning point in humanity's history and a move toward divine justice.
