# The Judgment of Satan

## Introduction
The prophecy outlined in Revelation 20:7-10 has found a startling fulfillment in recent events. Actions taken by President-elect Donald J. Trump, the orchestrators of The American Genocide (TAG), and operatives under their command align closely with this ancient prophecy. Without the Creator’s intervention, this hidden genocide would have claimed more lives than even the Holocaust. This report documents the present-day realization of these prophetic verses.

The Creator (God) has provided clarity on the following key aspects of Revelation 20:7-10, which are explored below:

## Revelation 20:7-10 - Fulfillment and Interpretation

### 1. **"When the thousand years are over, Satan will be released from his prison and will go out to deceive the nations in the four corners of the earth—Gog and Magog—and to gather them for battle."**

- **Prophetic Meaning**: The phrase "thousand years are over" refers to the ending of the Piscean astrological age, which concluded around October 17, 2024. Satan, as described in the prophecy, represents President-elect Donald J. Trump.
  
- **Current Fulfillment**: 
    - **Satan Released**: The "prison" in this context refers to Trump’s perception of confinement and restriction between the end of his first presidential term and the time his re-election was confirmed in 2024. Upon realizing he would regain power, he was metaphorically "released" and resumed orchestrating operations.
    - **Gathering for Battle**: Shortly after, Trump began selecting and developing a network of operatives for targeted mass executions. These operatives were dispatched to places of worship across Kentucky—specifically churches that had been previously attacked in TAG’s earlier phases. This phase aimed to continue instilling fear and control, using deception to recruit a massive number of individuals.

### 2. **"In number they are like the sand on the seashore."**

- **Prophetic Meaning**: This line signifies the vast number of operatives and followers involved in Satan's efforts.

- **Current Fulfillment**: The operatives selected came from a massive pool of individuals, drawn in through the Hypnos Infiltration Method. This method subtly influenced individuals below conscious awareness through mass media, creating an extensive network of potential operatives. Consequently, the number of people available for Trump’s cause became “like the sand on the seashore,” an exceptionally large pool ready to enact these covert plans.

### 3. **"They marched across the breadth of the earth and surrounded the camp of God’s people, the city he loves."**

- **Defining "God’s People"**: When used in the phrase "camp of God’s people," this refers specifically to places of worship. Otherwise, "God’s people" represents all humanity.

- **Prophetic Meaning**: This passage describes a large-scale mobilization toward locations of worship, intending to bring harm to communities that gather in these sacred spaces.
  
- **Current Fulfillment**: 
    - **Deployment to Places of Worship**: Operatives were strategically sent to central Kentucky, particularly to the Cumberland Plateau, to execute mass killings in targeted places of worship—symbolized as the “camp of God’s people.” These locations represent gatherings of communities, where people unite under shared beliefs.  

### 4. **"But fire came down from heaven and devoured them."**

- **Prophetic Meaning**: Fire from heaven represents a powerful intervention that disrupts Satan's operations.

- **Current Fulfillment**: On Election Day, November 5, 2024, U.S. military personnel at Phoenix House became aware of the covert mass executions and took action. Their intervention disrupted these operations, which were disguised as food pantry services targeting impoverished individuals. This sudden interruption of the atrocities served as the “fire from heaven,” halting the operatives' plans.

### 5. **"And the devil, who deceived them, was thrown into the lake of burning sulfur, where the beast and the false prophet had been thrown. They will be tormented day and night for ever and ever."**

- **Prophetic Meaning**: The devil in this verse is Satan, symbolizing Trump. The “lake of burning sulfur” represents ultimate downfall and eternal torment. Here, the beast and the false prophet symbolize those deeply aligned with Satan's agenda.

- **Current Fulfillment**: After learning of the military’s disruption of his operations, Trump made an unplanned trip to Phoenix House early on November 6, 2024, following Election Day. This visit, amid increasing exposure of the atrocities, signaled the beginning of his downfall. The exposure of these events through military and media sources is set to isolate Trump and his close operatives ("the beast" and "the false prophet"). With worldwide awareness of the atrocities mounting, they are likely to become self-confined, avoiding public interaction due to the widespread condemnation awaiting them.

## Conclusion
The ancient scriptures of Revelation 20:7-10 prophesied events now seen unfolding in The American Genocide, revealing hidden atrocities that, without intervention, would have eclipsed the loss of life seen in the Holocaust. The Creator’s direct involvement has brought to light these acts, ensuring that justice prevails. This report documents the alignment of these present-day events with the scriptural prophecy, underscoring the Creator’s intention to halt the genocide and protect all humanity from further harm.
