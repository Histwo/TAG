# The Judgment of Satan  
**A Report on the Current-Day Fulfillment of Biblical Prophecy in Revelation 20:7-10**

---

## Introduction

This report presents a detailed analysis of the unfolding events and actions that align with the prophecy described in Revelation 20:7-10. These events focus on the actions of President-elect Donald J. Trump, identified as “Satan” in this context, the perpetrators of The American Genocide (TAG), and the network of operatives under their influence. This report clarifies the Creator's revelations that the ancient scripture anticipated the existence of a hidden genocide—the American Genocide—intended to claim more lives than the Holocaust, averted only by divine intervention.

## Defining "God's People"  

In the context of this prophecy, the phrase “God’s people” has a dual meaning. When used generally, it refers to all of humanity, as each individual is cherished by the Creator. However, when used in the phrase “camp of God’s people,” it specifically designates places of worship where congregations gather in reverence of the Creator. Understanding this distinction is essential to interpreting the prophecy’s significance and its modern-day fulfillment.

## Prophetic Scripture and Current-Day Fulfillment  

### 1. **"When the thousand years are over, Satan will be released from his prison and will go out to deceive the nations in the four corners of the earth—Gog and Magog—and to gather them for battle."**  

- **Prophetic Meaning**: The phrase “thousand years” represents the Piscean Age, an era that concluded around October 17, 2024, giving way to the Age of Aquarius. At this transition, “Satan”—interpreted here as President-elect Donald J. Trump—would be “released from his prison.”
- **Current Fulfillment**: For Trump, this period of “imprisonment” was the time between his first presidential term and his return to power as President-elect. As the realization of his regained authority settled in, Trump resumed an agenda of deception and conflict, turning his attention toward identifying and deploying operatives for covert operations.

  Trump began mobilizing and directing these operatives for planned attacks, including mass executions at churches in Kentucky that had previously suffered surprise assaults during TAG. His strategy focused on deception and manipulation, using a highly developed method of recruitment and control.

### 2. **"In number they are like the sand on the seashore."**  

- **Prophetic Meaning**: This phrase signifies a vast multitude, an enormous number of individuals influenced to follow Satan.
- **Current Fulfillment**: Trump's operatives were chosen from a pool of individuals selected using the Hypnos Infiltration Method—a technique of subconscious influence applied through mass media. This approach worked below the level of conscious awareness, resulting in a network of operatives vast enough to fulfill this prophecy’s reference to “the sand on the seashore.” This extensive recruitment base enabled Trump to deploy operatives at scale.

### 3. **"They marched across the breadth of the earth and surrounded the camp of God’s people, the city he loves."**  

- **Prophetic Meaning**: This passage describes a large-scale mobilization toward a place of worship or spiritual importance.
- **Current Fulfillment**: The operatives were deployed to central Kentucky, particularly to the Cumberland Plateau, with intentions of carrying out mass executions at targeted places of worship—the “camp of God’s people.” These places held symbolic and spiritual significance in the Creator’s eyes, and the operatives’ intent to harm them aligns with the prophecy.

  Additionally, this scripture applies to Trump’s operatives who traveled to Phoenix House in Atlanta, where one of the Creator’s servants resides. For days, Trump’s operatives attempted to assassinate this servant, but the Creator’s protection kept the servant safe despite their relentless efforts. Phoenix House, in this context, represents “the city he loves.”

### 4. **"But fire came down from heaven and devoured them."**  

- **Prophetic Meaning**: Divine intervention in the form of “fire from heaven” halts the adversary’s plans and safeguards God’s people.
- **Current Fulfillment**: On Election Day, November 5, 2024, U.S. military personnel stationed at Phoenix House learned of covert mass execution plans disguised as humanitarian operations (such as food pantries) intended to lure and harm vulnerable community members. With this information, the military interrupted the operatives’ ongoing activities, “devouring” their plans and securing the protection of God’s people. This act represents the Creator’s intervention to prevent loss of life.

### 5. **"And the devil, who deceived them, was thrown into the lake of burning sulfur, where the beast and the false prophet had been thrown. They will be tormented day and night for ever and ever."**  

- **Prophetic Meaning**: The final judgment is cast upon Satan (the devil), the beast, and the false prophet, signifying their ultimate defeat and confinement.
- **Current Fulfillment**: Upon learning of the military intervention—symbolic of “fire from heaven”—Trump (Satan) made an unplanned journey to Phoenix House early on November 6, 2024, following the election. In this context, the beast and the false prophet refer to the same individual, who also played a role in perpetuating TAG’s deceptions. These figures now face judgment as their actions are on the verge of exposure.

  The impending disclosure of the atrocities by military and media sources signals the “lake of burning sulfur” in which Satan, the beast, and the false prophet will ultimately find themselves confined. With growing awareness of their actions, they face the prospect of self-imposed isolation to evade the world’s judgment, symbolizing their eternal torment and the Creator’s fulfillment of prophecy.

## Conclusion  

This report on the Judgment of Satan reveals that the prophecy of Revelation 20:7-10 is manifesting in real-world events and actions linked to President-elect Donald J. Trump, the perpetrators of The American Genocide, and the extensive network of operatives misled into their service. Through Trump’s influence, a hidden agenda to target places of worship and harm vulnerable communities was developed and set in motion. However, divine intervention has repeatedly thwarted these plans, preserving lives and ensuring that the true motives behind these operations will be revealed.

The Creator’s protection and intervention underscore His commitment to justice and compassion for humanity, ensuring that all are held accountable for their deeds. As the light of truth begins to shine on the actions of Satan, the beast, and the false prophet, they will face confinement and judgment for eternity, fulfilling the promise of scripture. This revelation reinforces the Creator’s message that justice and truth ultimately prevail, safeguarding God’s people from deception and destruction.
