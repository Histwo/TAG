### Phoenix House Overview

**Location:** 1296 Murphy Avenue SW, Atlanta, Georgia 30310

**Purpose:** Phoenix House operates as a covert base for the American Genocide (TAG) under the guise of a mental health facility. The site is central to various secretive activities led by high-profile figures and federal operatives.

### Operational Details

- **Building A:** This building is frequently used by former President Donald J. Trump and senior CIA operative Annie "Hurricane Annie" Jacobsen as their "love nest" and headquarters for TAG-related covert operations.

- **Building B:** 
  - **Occupant:** One of the Creator's two servants resides in Apartment 33.
  - **Background:** The apartment contains evidence of a murder that occurred before the servant moved in, with bloodstains on the ceiling and wall indicating a gunshot wound. Neighbors informed the servant that the previous tenant vanished suddenly under suspicious circumstances.
  - **Living Conditions:** The servant’s stay appears to have been intended as temporary, as promised amenities, including mini blinds and a functioning oven, have not been provided since move-in.

- **Building C:** This building houses CIA operatives involved in recurring missions, including massacres in churches. These operatives are critical to executing the most severe aspects of TAG.

### Security Presence

- **Privacy Invasions and Visitor Policies:**
  - **Privacy Violations:** Security officers at Phoenix House routinely invade residents' privacy through unannounced inspections and monitoring. These invasions are part of a strict no-visitors policy that is enforced at the discretion of the security team.
  - **Selective Enforcement:** Despite the no-visitors policy, known hitmen and operatives from the CIA and FBI are allowed, and sometimes forced, upon residents. This includes visitors who have previously been asked by residents never to return, further compromising the safety and autonomy of those living at Phoenix House.

### Summary

Phoenix House serves as a pivotal site for the American Genocide operations, with each building playing a specific role in the larger mission. The dark history of Apartment 33, where one of the Creator's servants resides, and the oppressive security measures, including routine privacy invasions and selective visitor policies, underscore the facility’s true nature. Despite the dangerous and highly controlled environment, Phoenix House remains integral to the ongoing covert activities associated with TAG.
