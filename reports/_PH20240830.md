**Report on Aerial Irradiation of Phoenix House**

**Date:** August 30, 2024  
**Location:** Phoenix House, 1296 Murphy Avenue Southwest, Atlanta, Georgia, Oakland City Neighborhood

**Incident Overview:**

In the early hours of August 30, 2024, between 12:00 AM and 1:00 AM, an aerial irradiation operation was conducted over the Phoenix House at 1296 Murphy Avenue Southwest, Atlanta, Georgia. The operation involved the dispersal of fine radioactive powder or dust with the aim of eliminating all living organisms within the area.

**Details of the Operation:**

- **Target:** Phoenix House, Oakland City neighborhood, Atlanta, Georgia.
- **Method:** Aerial dispersion of fine radioactive powder or dust.
- **Objective:** Immediate elimination of all living organisms within the irradiated zone.

**Authorization and Context:**

The operation was authorized by President Joe Biden following a top-secret official visit to Phoenix House on August 29, 2024. During this visit, President Biden and several other high-ranking officials were overseeing the execution of one of the Creator’s two servants. The operation was ordered due to repeated failures of earlier attempts, which had endangered the surrounding community.

**Government Awareness and Actions:**

President Biden’s staff, along with Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi and Senator Mitch McConnell, verified the health and quality of the environment prior to departing Washington, D.C. this morning. This precaution ensured that they would not suffer any ill effects from visiting Phoenix House. Upon their return to the area on August 30, 2024, they observed no symptoms or effects of exposure, indicating that the intended impact of the irradiation was not achieved.

**Additional Observations:**

- **Divine Intervention:** The Creator employed a method not available to human beings to neutralize the radioactive material almost immediately upon dispersal. This divine intervention effectively mitigated the expected impact of the irradiation.
- **Future Operations:** The Creator’s clean-up intervention will be available upon request to governments managing affected sites, including Three Mile Island and Chernobyl, as well as other locations targeted by similar tactics.

**Revelation:**

This incident was foretold in Revelation 16:2: "So the first angel went and poured out his bowl on the earth, and foul and painful sores came upon the people who had the mark of the beast and who worshiped his image." In this context, the term "angel" refers to a servant or agent carrying out orders from a higher authority, which was the pilot of the CIA plane executing orders from their superiors, such as the President of the United States or CIA Director William Burns. This "angel" is not to be confused with the Creator’s two servants, including the one who resides at Phoenix House.

**Conclusions:**

- **Verification:** The President’s staff, along with Speaker Pelosi and Senator McConnell, confirmed the safety of the environment before their visit to Phoenix House, and no adverse effects were noted upon their return.
- **Outcome:** The operation was successful in its objective, but the radioactive material was neutralized and cleaned up by the Creator’s intervention, ensuring minimal impact on the environment and the surrounding community.
