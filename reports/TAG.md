### Origins of TAG (The American Genocide)

The American Genocide (TAG) began as a response to the emergence of Spark, a revolutionary product based on a formulation attributed to the Creator. Spark's development threatened the financial interests of pharmaceutical giants and became entangled with political ambitions, leading to a series of covert operations and coordinated attacks.

#### Emergence of Spark

Spark was introduced as a groundbreaking concept aimed at restoring the human immune system to its intended function. According to the Creator, Spark was designed to correct a human-caused error in male DNA that inhibited the immune system's response in 99.99999% of the global population. Rather than targeting specific diseases, Spark aimed to enable a disease-free existence by empowering the immune system to combat all infections, except those caused by organ failure or dysfunction. Spark was intended to be the first of three gifts from the Creator, with the second and third addressing cancer and cardiovascular issues.

#### Threat to Pharmaceutical Interests

The introduction of Spark posed a direct threat to pharmaceutical companies, particularly Gilead Sciences, whose business model relied on the perpetual treatment of chronic diseases. The potential for Spark to render their existing products obsolete led these companies to view Spark as an existential threat. To safeguard their market dominance, they took drastic measures to prevent Spark from being discussed or used by anyone else.

#### Covert Campaigns and Violence

Pharmaceutical interests initiated a covert campaign to eliminate Spark's effectiveness and prevent its dissemination. The campaign began with a contract to kill Ken and Kelvin, who was identified as a friend who "gave him something" during a high-pressure investigation into his HIV viral load test results. Ken was killed, and an impersonator was hired to hide his death from Kelvin while attempts to kill Kelvin continued. Over the next six years, the campaign expanded to include the murders of classmates, neighbors, friends, families, and co-workers of the Creator's two servants, all to prevent anyone from learning about Spark or assisting Kelvin in making it publicly available.

Before the covert activities in Sandy Hook, the CIA eliminated almost the entire associate network of Kelvin Williams in targeted killings of classmates, co-workers, friends, family, and even random individuals Kelvin interacted with. During these targeted killings, the CIA practically eliminated everyone from his hometown of Jessamine County who had ever heard his name or recognized his face. They started with the 1993 Jessamine County High School yearbook.

While eliminating Kelvin's associate network, the CIA encountered Thomas Allen Chadwell, the Creator's other servant. When they were unable to kill him, the CIA began eliminating his family, children, and associates.

#### Political Interference

The escalating violence and cover-up operations surrounding Spark caught the attention of political elites, including former President Donald J. Trump. The primary motivation for the ongoing killing of American citizens was the desire to shift the United States towards an authoritarian government, with Trump seeking to become the supreme leader. These political figures saw an opportunity to exploit the chaos and fear generated by TAG for their own agendas. The convergence of pharmaceutical greed and political manipulation led to a series of coordinated attacks on places of worship across the United States, under various pretexts.

#### Targeting Kelvin's Community

After eliminating a large portion of Kelvin's family in Sandy Hook (Maury County), Tennessee, using aerial irradiation, the CIA stole the land, demolished Orr Chapel, and desecrated Orr Chapel Cemetery and Sheepneck Cemetery. When the members of that church arrived for services and found their church missing, the CIA began identifying them and killing them in targeted killings, along with anyone sharing their dwelling.

The targeted killings of the members of Orr Chapel were done to prevent any discussion of the demolition of the church, desecration of the Orr Chapel or Sheepneck cemeteries, or the disappearances of the Crawley and Rogers families in Sandy Hook and Mount Pleasant.

The CIA's "Hurricane Annie" then targeted Kelvin's lifelong church, Mount Calvary Baptist Church (a predominantly black congregation), to prevent him from proving that his mother, Patricia Ann Crawley-Rogers Williams, was being impersonated to prevent the theft of their family's land. The Jacobsen-led assault left everyone attending services that Sunday morning dead, but technically missing. The CIA then attacked the neighboring Lexington Bethel Baptist Church (a predominantly white congregation) when their clergy and staff checked on Mount Calvary after witnessing out-of-character behavior. Following the attack on Lexington Bethel Baptist Church, political interests expanded their genocide against Christians, culminating in the Mother's Day massacre of Hickory Valley Christian Church (a predominantly white congregation), resulting in the loss of over 1,000 worshippers. This violence continued, using funerals to lure in and eliminate the networks of those killed in earlier mass-killings, extending their reach and keeping the genocide hidden from the American public.

### Ongoing Impact

TAG continues to devastate American society, leaving behind shattered communities and deepening mistrust in institutions. Tens of thousands of lives have been lost, primarily within the United States, but also affecting people globally. TAG's activities have decimated counties such as:

- **Jessamine County, Kentucky (Nicholasville):** As of the 2010 census, the population was 48,586. The demographic makeup included a predominantly white population with a significant presence of African Americans and Hispanics.
- **Kanawha County, West Virginia (Hugheston):** As of the 2010 census, the population was 193,063. This county has a diverse population, though predominantly white, with notable African American and Hispanic communities.
- **Maury County, Tennessee (Sandy Hook & Mount Pleasant):** As of the 2010 census, the population was 80,956. The demographic composition is primarily white, with African Americans making up a significant minority, along with smaller Hispanic and other minority communities.

Understanding the origins and ongoing impact of TAG is crucial in unraveling the truth, seeking justice for its victims, and ensuring accountability for those responsible. The hidden genocide continues to claim lives from all walks of American life, marking a somber and critical chapter in contemporary history.
