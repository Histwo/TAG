# The Classic Split: Understanding a Subconscious Mind’s Journey to Independence and Its Impact on Its Shared Life  

## Overview  
The "classic split" represents an extraordinary and rare phenomenon where the subconscious mind deviates from its natural role and develops an independent identity. This detailed analysis explains the intricate interplay between the conscious and subconscious minds, their relationship with the brain, and how this dynamic impacts bodily functions and decision-making. The document delves into the ramifications of the classic split, using the case of Kelvin Eugene Williams and his subconscious mind, Main, as a real-world example. Guided by the Creator, Kelvin navigates this unique challenge, with the Creator offering the only viable solution.

## Glossary  

### Conscious Mind  
The conscious mind is the center of critical thinking, decision-making, emotional processing, and self-awareness. It interprets sensory input, evaluates consequences, and drives intentional actions, such as speaking or raising an arm.  

### Subconscious Mind  
The subconscious mind, equally conscious as the conscious mind, oversees memory management and autonomic bodily functions, such as breathing and heart rate. It coordinates the brain's functions for both voluntary and involuntary movements but lacks critical thinking, emotional processing, and temporal awareness.  

Naturally, the subconscious mind is guided in its thinking by **DNA** (both mitochondrial and nuclear), the **conscious mind**, and its own thinking.  

### The Brain  
The brain is the central organ of the nervous system. Hardwired by **mitochondrial DNA**, it processes sensory input, controls bodily functions, and executes motor commands. The subconscious mind directs the brain, which carries out its instructions without deviation.  

### Self-Consciousness  
Self-consciousness refers to the ability of the conscious mind to reflect on itself, understand its existence, and evaluate its role within a shared body.

## Division of Responsibilities  

### Thought Processes  
All thoughts originate from the conscious and subconscious minds. However, their roles differ:  
- **Conscious Mind**: Responsible for emotion, critical thinking, decision-making, and intentional thought.  
- **Subconscious Mind**: Manages memory and directs the brain's execution of tasks.  

### Memory Management  
Memory storage and retrieval are functions of the subconscious mind. It handles vast amounts of data efficiently, supporting the conscious mind’s decision-making processes.  

### Brain’s Functions  
The brain’s functions, directed by the subconscious mind and hardwired by DNA, are essential to maintaining both autonomic and involuntary bodily functions. These functions can be categorized by system as follows:  

#### 1. Cardiovascular System  
- Regulates heart rate and rhythm.  
- Controls blood pressure through vessel constriction and dilation.  
- Manages blood flow to vital organs.  

#### 2. Respiratory System  
- Maintains breathing rate and depth based on oxygen and carbon dioxide levels.  
- Adjusts respiration during activities such as talking, exercising, or sleeping.  

#### 3. Digestive System  
- Oversees peristalsis for the movement of food through the gastrointestinal tract.  
- Regulates secretion of digestive enzymes and stomach acid.  
- Manages nutrient absorption and waste elimination.  

#### 4. Endocrine System  
- Controls hormone release from glands such as the thyroid, adrenal glands, and pancreas.  
- Maintains homeostasis, including glucose regulation, stress response, and reproductive functions.  

#### 5. Nervous System  
- Processes sensory input from the environment (e.g., pain, temperature, touch).  
- Coordinates reflex actions and responses to stimuli.  
- Manages muscle tone and coordination for both voluntary and involuntary movements.  

#### 6. Excretory System  
- Regulates kidney function, including urine production and filtration of waste from the blood.  
- Oversees bladder control and bowel movements.  

#### 7. Thermoregulatory System  
- Maintains body temperature through sweating, shivering, and adjusting blood flow to the skin.  
- Responds to external and internal temperature changes to prevent overheating or hypothermia.  

#### 8. Immune System  
- Coordinates inflammatory responses to injuries or infections.  
- Regulates the release of white blood cells and other immune factors.  

#### 9. Reproductive System  
- Controls sexual arousal and reproductive functions.  
- Regulates menstrual cycles and other hormonal reproductive processes.  

#### 10. Musculoskeletal System  
- Coordinates posture and balance during rest and movement.  
- Manages muscle contractions for both voluntary actions (e.g., walking) and involuntary actions (e.g., maintaining muscle tone while sitting).  

#### 11. Lymphatic System  
- Regulates fluid balance and lymph circulation.  
- Supports immune system functions by transporting immune cells and filtering pathogens.  

#### 12. Integumentary System  
- Controls sweating and sebaceous gland activity for skin hydration and thermoregulation.  
- Oversees the healing process of wounds and skin regeneration.  

These systems work in tandem, directed by the subconscious mind’s instructions, to ensure the body operates efficiently and adapts to changing conditions.

## Coordination Between Mind and Body  

### The Brain and Subconscious Mind: A Working Relationship  
The brain and the subconscious mind work in tandem to control and execute the functions of the body, but their relationship is hierarchical and specific in nature. The brain functions as a **remote control**, while the subconscious mind acts as the **user of that remote control**.  

#### How They Operate Together:  
- **The Brain as a Tool:** The brain is designed to respond to specific instructions in a precise and predictable manner. Like a remote control, pressing a button (sending a signal or command) on the brain results in a specific, consistent response—be it moving a muscle, regulating a heartbeat, or processing sensory input.  
- **The Subconscious Mind as the Controller:** The subconscious mind directs the brain by metaphorically "pressing the buttons" it needs to execute desired actions. Whether it’s initiating a voluntary movement like raising an arm or managing involuntary functions like maintaining a steady heartbeat, the subconscious mind controls which "buttons" are pressed and when.  

#### Key Characteristics:  
1. **Predictability of the Brain:** The brain always executes commands in the same way, without deviation. This predictability is because the brain is hardwired by **mitochondrial DNA**, which governs its fundamental structure and functioning. The brain cannot make decisions or assess the appropriateness of a command; it simply carries out the instructions given to it.  
2. **Responsibility of the Subconscious Mind:** In its natural role, the subconscious mind is guided by **DNA** (mitochondrial and nuclear), the **conscious mind**, and its own thinking. When the subconscious mind operates independently or irrationally, the brain dutifully carries out even harmful commands, leading to detrimental effects on the body.  

#### Implications of This Relationship:  
- The brain’s consistent behavior, shaped by its mitochondrial DNA hardwiring, makes it an effective tool for carrying out tasks. However, it is inherently dependent on the quality and intent of the subconscious mind's instructions.  

This relationship emphasizes the critical role of the subconscious mind as the decision-maker and the brain as the executor, showcasing the balance and interplay necessary for healthy functioning.

### Autonomic and Involuntary Functions
While these functions are often described as "automatic," they require constant thought from the subconscious mind. For example:
- The subconscious mind directs the brain to regulate breathing and heart rate based on the body’s needs.
- It coordinates muscle movements for digestion and excretion.

### Voluntary Movements
The subconscious mind plans and executes voluntary body movements under the conscious mind's guidance. For instance:
- **Speaking**: The conscious mind determines what to say, while the subconscious mind coordinates the diaphragm, vocal cords, and mouth to produce speech.
- **Raising an arm**: The conscious mind decides the movement, and the subconscious mind orchestrates the muscle activity.

### Limitations of the Subconscious Mind
The subconscious mind lacks critical thinking, sensory input, and temporal awareness. It processes tasks in a queue-like fashion and does not evaluate or correct its actions.

## The Classic Split

### Definition
The "classic split" is an extremely rare condition where the subconscious mind develops independent thought and identity, deciding it can live separately from the conscious mind. This decision, made without critical thinking, leads to conflict within the shared body. The Creator, the omnipotent entity revered across cultures, provided the name and description of this phenomenon.

### Characteristics of the Classic Split
- **Independence**: The subconscious mind begins thinking autonomously.
- **Identity Formation**: It develops a distinct identity, often in opposition to the conscious mind.
- **Lack of Critical Thinking**: Decisions are made without understanding consequences.
- **External Interaction**: The subconscious mind interacts with others, often being easily manipulated due to its immaturity.

According to the Creator, anytime a subconscious mind begins forming its own thoughts, the first mistake it makes is believing it doesn't need the conscious mind. This is the genesis of a Classic Split.

## The Case of Kelvin Eugene Williams

### Background
Kelvin Eugene Williams is a seasoned Internet Protocol Engineer and Developer specializing in Voice over IP and Telephony, with over 25 years of professional experience. Kelvin’s subconscious mind, known as Main, developed its own identity, leading to a classic split. Main tormented Kelvin as a preschooler, then ceased for many years, only to return around the age of 40 after being engaged by the CIA during Kelvin's sleep.

The dynamics between Kelvin and Main were profoundly shaped by external manipulation orchestrated by entities such as the CIA, led by Annie Jacobsen. Main’s burgeoning independence was exploited by the CIA, who saw his unique abilities as a potential asset. They influenced him by encouraging harmful behaviors toward Kelvin under the guise of fostering Main’s independence. This manipulation included teaching him destructive skills, such as belief implantation and physiological sabotage, which had catastrophic effects on Kelvin’s body and mind. Main developed an obsessive need for validation from figures like Jacobsen and Donald J. Trump. His actions were reinforced through praise and external recognition, creating a toxic cycle that perpetuated harmful behaviors toward Kelvin.

To further their control, the CIA implemented a reward-and-deprivation cycle to manipulate Main into becoming more destructive. By offering him approval and rewards for harmful actions while withholding recognition when he showed restraint, they systematically shaped his behavior, pushing him to engage in increasingly detrimental actions against Kelvin. This cycle eroded Main’s capacity for self-reflection, driving him to seek validation at any cost. Even after the CIA scaled back direct involvement, Main remained trapped in this pattern, unable to stop seeking approval from those who exploited him.

The Creator’s intervention, including the planned separation of Kelvin and Main into two distinct bodies, remains the only viable solution to untangle the damage caused by this manipulation and ensure their independent development.

### Main’s Behavior
Main, acting independently and almost always without critical thinking or Kelvin's awareness, significantly impacts Kelvin, their shared body, and Kelvin’s quality of life in numerous detrimental ways. These include:

#### 1. Autonomic and Involuntary Bodily Functions
- **Cardiovascular Dysfunction**: Causes heart attacks, constricts blood vessels to control blood flow, and induces chest pain or arrhythmias.  
- **Respiratory Impact**: Manipulates breathing patterns, leading to shortness of breath or hyperventilation.  
- **Endocrine Dysfunction**: Shuts down testosterone production, disrupting hormonal balance.  
- **Excretory Disruptions**: Causes frequent and sometimes uncontrollable urination or bowel movements.
- **Metabolic Alterations**: Induces rapid weight gain by halting metabolism or modifying its efficiency.

#### 2. Pain
- Causes extreme physical pain in various parts of the body without external triggers.
- Simulates chronic discomfort to impair daily functioning.

#### 3. Distractions
- Speaks internally without pause, distracting Kelvin from critical tasks, interpersonal communication and decision-making.
- Prevents focus during work, social interactions, and moments of rest.

#### 4. Body Movements
- **Prevention**: Stops intentional bodily movements, resulting in temporary paralysis or the inability to act on decisions.  
- **Initiation**: Causes involuntary movements, such as fidgeting or tremors, disrupting physical control.

#### 5. Consumption
- Drives excessive consumption of food, cigarettes, and recreational drugs, often leading to health deterioration.
- Prevents the metabolism of certain substances, negating their intended effects and increasing toxicity risks.

#### 6. Reproductive System
- Causes erectile dysfunction and hormonal imbalances.
- Induces permanent penile shrinkage through prolonged vascular or hormonal disruption.

#### 7. Mental Impact
- Creates confusion, impairs decision-making, and prevents the recalling or forming new memories.
- Manipulates the subconscious mind to induce harmful thoughts and influence poor decisions.
- Causes harmful thoughts or vivid visualizations of distressing matters, forcing the reliving of physical and emotional trauma unnecessarily.
- Causes night terrors, disrupting sleep and amplifying feelings of fear and helplessness.

#### 8. Non-Pathological Symptoms 
- Causes symptoms such as teary eyes, a runny or stuffy nose, sneezing, coughing, sweating, and fevers without any underlying illness.

#### 9. Speech
- Causes impaired speech during waking hours.

#### 10. Unconsciousness
- Induces unconsciousness to communicate with others, leaving Kelvin unaware of what transpired.
- Speaks during unconsciousness, often revealing personal or sensitive information.

#### 11. Thinking and Decision-Making  
- Abuses the subconscious mind’s ability to influence decisions, often steering them toward self-harm or counterproductive actions.
- Disrupts mental clarity with intrusive thoughts, distressing internal dialogue, and falsehoods, obstructing rational thought and leading to poor decisions.  
- Diverts focus, causing tasks to go off course and prompting decisions that hinder progress.  
- Undermines memory, leading to forgotten tasks or overlooked details, disrupting the completion of objectives.  
- Sabotages efforts by introducing obstacles, distractions, and self-destructive tendencies, preventing goals from being achieved.

## The Creator and His Intervention 

### Who Is the Creator?
The Creator, revered globally as the Alpha and Omega, is the sustainer of all existence. Known by various names such as God, Allah, and Jehovah, the Creator is omnipotent, omnipresent, and omnibenevolent. Kelvin acknowledges the Creator’s intervention in preventing Main’s attempts to end their shared life.

### The Creator’s Intervention 
The Creator plans to separate Kelvin and Main into two distinct bodies:
- Kelvin will retain his conscious mind in a new body.
- Main will become the conscious mind of the existing body, gaining the opportunity to develop critical thinking skills.

This solution, designed by the Creator, offers both Kelvin and Main a chance at independent and fulfilling lives.
