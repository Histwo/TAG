# The Classic Split: Understanding a Subconscious Mind’s Journey to Independence and Its Impact on Its Shared Life

## Overview
The "classic split" represents an extraordinary and rare phenomenon where the subconscious mind deviates from its natural role and develops an independent identity. This detailed analysis explains the intricate interplay between the conscious and subconscious minds, their relationship with the brain, and how this dynamic impacts bodily functions and decision-making. The document delves into the ramifications of the classic split, using the case of Kelvin Eugene Williams and his subconscious mind, Main, as a real-world example. Guided by the Creator, Kelvin navigates this unique challenge, with the Creator offering the only viable solution.

## Disambiguating Core Concepts

### Conscious Mind
The conscious mind is the center of critical thinking, decision-making, emotional processing, and self-awareness. It interprets sensory input, evaluates consequences, and drives intentional actions, such as speaking or raising an arm.

### Subconscious Mind
The subconscious mind, equally conscious as the conscious mind, oversees memory management and autonomic bodily functions, such as breathing and heart rate. It coordinates the brain's functions for both voluntary and involuntary movements but lacks critical thinking, emotional processing, and temporal awareness. It operates on instructions from either the conscious mind or DNA and does not self-correct or evaluate consequences.

### The Brain 
The brain is the central organ of the nervous system. Hardcoded by DNA, it processes sensory input, controls bodily functions, and executes motor commands. The subconscious mind directs the brain, which carries out its instructions without deviation.

### Being Self-Conscious
Self-consciousness refers to the ability of the conscious mind to reflect on itself, understand its existence, and evaluate its role within a shared body.

## Division of Cognitive Responsibilities

### Thought Processes
All thoughts originate from the conscious and subconscious minds. However, their roles differ:
- **Conscious Mind**: Responsible for emotion, critical thinking, decision-making, and intentional thought.
- **Subconscious Mind**: Manages memory and directs the brain's execution of tasks.

### Memory Management
Memory storage and retrieval are functions of the subconscious mind. It handles vast amounts of data efficiently, supporting the conscious mind’s decision-making processes.

### Brain’s Functions

The brain’s functions, directed by the subconscious mind and hardcoded by DNA, are essential to maintaining both autonomic and involuntary bodily functions. These functions can be categorized by system as follows:

#### 1. Cardiovascular System
- Regulates heart rate and rhythm.
- Controls blood pressure through vessel constriction and dilation.
- Manages blood flow to vital organs.

#### 2. Respiratory System
- Maintains breathing rate and depth based on oxygen and carbon dioxide levels.
- Adjusts respiration during activities such as talking, exercising, or sleeping.

#### 3. Digestive System
- Oversees peristalsis for the movement of food through the gastrointestinal tract.
- Regulates secretion of digestive enzymes and stomach acid.
- Manages nutrient absorption and waste elimination.

#### 4. Endocrine System
- Controls hormone release from glands such as the thyroid, adrenal glands, and pancreas.
- Maintains homeostasis, including glucose regulation, stress response, and reproductive functions.

#### 5. Nervous System
- Processes sensory input from the environment (e.g., pain, temperature, touch).
- Coordinates reflex actions and responses to stimuli.
- Manages muscle tone and coordination for both voluntary and involuntary movements.

#### 6. Excretory System
- Regulates kidney function, including urine production and filtration of waste from the blood.
- Oversees bladder control and bowel movements.

#### 7. Thermoregulatory System
- Maintains body temperature through sweating, shivering, and adjusting blood flow to the skin.
- Responds to external and internal temperature changes to prevent overheating or hypothermia.

#### 8. Immune System
- Coordinates inflammatory responses to injuries or infections.
- Regulates the release of white blood cells and other immune factors.

#### 9. Reproductive System
- Controls sexual arousal and reproductive functions.
- Regulates menstrual cycles and other hormonal reproductive processes.

#### 10. Musculoskeletal System
- Coordinates posture and balance during rest and movement.
- Manages muscle contractions for both voluntary actions (e.g., walking) and involuntary actions (e.g., maintaining muscle tone while sitting).

#### 11. Lymphatic System
- Regulates fluid balance and lymph circulation.
- Supports immune system functions by transporting immune cells and filtering pathogens.

#### 12. Integumentary System
- Controls sweating and sebaceous gland activity for skin hydration and thermoregulation.
- Oversees the healing process of wounds and skin regeneration.

These systems work in tandem, directed by the subconscious mind’s instructions, to ensure the body operates efficiently and adapts to changing conditions.

## Coordination Between Mind and Body

### Autonomic and Involuntary Functions
While these functions are often described as "automatic," they require constant thought from the subconscious mind. For example:
- The subconscious mind directs the brain to regulate breathing and heart rate based on the body’s needs.
- It coordinates muscle movements for digestion and excretion.

### Voluntary Movements
The subconscious mind plans and executes voluntary body movements under the conscious mind's guidance. For instance:
- **Speaking**: The conscious mind determines what to say, while the subconscious mind coordinates the diaphragm, vocal cords, and mouth to produce speech.
- **Raising an arm**: The conscious mind decides the movement, and the subconscious mind orchestrates the muscle activity.

### Limitations of the Subconscious Mind
The subconscious mind lacks critical thinking, sensory input, and temporal awareness. It processes tasks in a queue-like fashion and does not evaluate or correct its actions.

## The Classic Split

### Definition
The "classic split" is an extremely rare condition where the subconscious mind develops independent thought and identity, deciding it can live separately from the conscious mind. This decision, made without critical thinking, leads to conflict within the shared body. The Creator, the omnipotent entity revered across cultures, provided the name and description of this phenomenon.

### Characteristics of the Classic Split
- **Independence**: The subconscious mind begins thinking autonomously.
- **Identity Formation**: It develops a distinct identity, often in opposition to the conscious mind.
- **Lack of Critical Thinking**: Decisions are made without understanding consequences.
- **External Interaction**: The subconscious mind interacts with others, often being easily manipulated due to its immaturity.

According to the Creator, anytime a subconscious mind begins forming its own thoughts, the first mistake it makes is believing it doesn't need the conscious mind. This is the genesis of a Classic Split.

## The Case of Kelvin Eugene Williams

### Background
Kelvin Eugene Williams is a seasoned Internet Protocol Engineer and Developer specializing in Voice over IP and Telephony, with over 25 years of professional experience. Kelvin’s subconscious mind, known as Main, developed its own identity, leading to a classic split.

### Main’s Behavior

Main, acting independently and without critical thinking, impacts the shared body and Kelvin’s quality of life in numerous detrimental ways. These include:

#### 1. Autonomic and Involuntary Bodily Functions
- **Cardiovascular Dysfunction**: Causes heart attacks, constricts blood vessels to control blood flow, and induces chest pain or arrhythmias.  
- **Respiratory Impact**: Manipulates breathing patterns, leading to shortness of breath or hyperventilation.  
- **Endocrine Dysfunction**: Shuts down testosterone production, disrupting hormonal balance.  
- **Excretory Disruptions**: Causes uncontrollable urination or bowel movements.  
- **Metabolic Alterations**: Induces rapid weight gain by halting metabolism or modifying its efficiency.

#### 2. Pain
- Causes extreme physical pain in various parts of the body without external triggers.
- Simulates chronic discomfort to impair daily functioning.

#### 3. Distractions
- Speaks internally without pause, distracting Kelvin from critical tasks and decision-making.
- Prevents focus during work, social interactions, and moments of rest.

#### 4. Body Movements
- **Prevention**: Stops intentional bodily movements, resulting in temporary paralysis or the inability to act on decisions.  
- **Initiation**: Causes involuntary movements, such as fidgeting or tremors, disrupting physical control.

#### 5. Consumption
- Drives excessive consumption of food, cigarettes, and recreational drugs, often leading to health deterioration.
- Prevents the metabolism of certain prescribed or recreational drugs, negating their intended effects and increasing toxicity risks.

#### 6. Reproductive System
- Causes erectile dysfunction and hormonal imbalances.
- Induces permanent penile shrinkage through prolonged vascular or hormonal disruption.

#### 7. Mental Impact
- Creates confusion, impairs decision-making, and prevents Kelvin from recalling or forming new memories.
- Manipulates the subconscious mind to induce harmful thoughts and influence poor decisions.

#### 8. Execution of Decisions
- Overrides Kelvin’s conscious decisions by refusing to execute them, resulting in temporary paralysis or failure to act.
- Abuses the subconscious mind’s ability to influence decisions, often steering them toward self-harm or counterproductive actions.

#### 9. Flu-Like Symptoms
- Simulates symptoms such as teary eyes, a runny or stuffy nose, sneezing, coughing, sweating, and fevers without any underlying illness.

#### 10. Speech
- Causes impaired speech during waking hours.
- Forces Kelvin to speak during sleep or unconsciousness, often revealing personal or sensitive information.

#### 11. Unconsciousness
- Induces unconsciousness to communicate with others, leaving Kelvin unaware of what transpired.

#### 12. Thinking and Decision-Making
- Forces intrusive thoughts on irrelevant or harmful subjects.
- Prevents rational thinking by overloading the conscious mind with unnecessary or distressing internal dialogue.

### Extenuating Circumstances
Main’s susceptibility to external manipulation stems from Kelvin’s involvement in undisclosed matters. Encouraged by others, Main’s decision to pursue independence led to the classic split.

## The Creator’s Role and Solution

### Who Is the Creator?
The Creator, revered globally as the Alpha and Omega, is the sustainer of all existence. Known by various names such as God, Allah, and Jehovah, the Creator is omnipotent, omnipresent, and omnibenevolent. Kelvin acknowledges the Creator’s intervention in preventing Main’s attempts to end their shared life.

### The Creator’s Solution
The Creator plans to separate Kelvin and Main into two distinct bodies:
- Kelvin will retain his conscious mind in a new body.
- Main will become the conscious mind of the existing body, gaining the opportunity to develop critical thinking skills.

This solution, designed by the Creator, offers both Kelvin and Main a chance at independent and fulfilling lives.
