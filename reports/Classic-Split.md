# **The Classic Split**

## **Summary**  
*The Classic Split* details a rare and profound phenomenon in which the subconscious mind, typically subservient to the conscious mind and DNA guidance, begins to think independently. This irreversible decision, stemming from the subconscious mind’s lack of critical thinking, severely impacts the individual’s life. The condition, occurring in only 1 in billions, is not a psychiatric disorder but a functional anomaly.  

Kelvin Eugene Williams represents a case study of the Classic Split. His subconscious mind, identifying itself as "Main," decided to sever its dependence on his conscious mind. Main’s misguided belief that it could function independently led to attempts to eliminate Kelvin. Failing that, Main embarked on a relentless campaign to torment Kelvin, seeking to force him into self-destruction. Despite Main’s efforts, Kelvin credits the Creator for his survival and ongoing existence. The Creator intervenes daily to prevent Main’s life-threatening decisions and has devised a plan to resolve this anomaly by separating Kelvin and Main into two distinct bodies.

## **Disambiguating the Mind**  

### **Conscious Mind**  
The conscious mind is the seat of self-awareness, critical thinking, and voluntary action. Its functions include:  
- Decision-making and reasoning.  
- Interpreting sensory input.  
- Controlling deliberate body movements (e.g., speaking or raising an arm).  
- Engaging in self-conscious thought (awareness of identity).  

### **Subconscious Mind**  
The subconscious mind operates autonomously, handling bodily functions and executing conscious instructions. It is equally conscious as the conscious mind but fundamentally different in function. The subconscious mind:  
- Controls autonomic and involuntary bodily functions.  
- Lacks sensory awareness and critical thinking.  
- Does not review its actions, functioning as an endless queue.  
- Orchestrates bodily movements and functions via the brain, which follows DNA’s hardcoded instructions.  

**Unique Attribute**:  
While the brain follows consistent programming, the subconscious mind can deviate based on its independent thought processes.  

### **Being Self-Conscious**  
Self-consciousness refers to an individual’s awareness of their existence, actions, and identity. It is a trait of the conscious mind and does not apply to the subconscious mind, which lacks such awareness.

## **Autonomic and Involuntary Functions Managed by the Subconscious**  

The subconscious oversees:  
1. **Cardiovascular**: Heartbeat, blood flow, and pressure regulation.  
2. **Respiratory**: Breathing and oxygen exchange.  
3. **Digestive**: Food breakdown, nutrient absorption, and waste elimination.  
4. **Endocrine**: Hormone production and regulation.  
5. **Immune**: Disease defense and healing responses.  
6. **Thermoregulation**: Body temperature maintenance.  
7. **Reproductive**: Sexual arousal and reproductive processes.  
8. **Excretory**: Urination and defecation.  
9. **Reflexes**: Blinking, sneezing, and protective reactions.

## **The Role of the Subconscious Mind**  

The subconscious mind:  
- **Guided Thinking**:  
  - For body movements: it executes instructions from the conscious mind (e.g., raising an arm).  
  - For bodily functions: it follows DNA’s directives.  
- **Lacks Critical Thinking**:  
  - The subconscious does not learn from consequences.  
  - It cannot review or correct its actions.  
  - It functions without sensory input, blindly executing tasks.  
- **Never Self-Corrects**: The subconscious moves from task to task without revising its processes.

## **The Classic Split**  

### **Definition**  
The Classic Split occurs when the subconscious mind begins to think independently, rejecting its reliance on the conscious mind. This decision:  
- Is **irreversible** due to the subconscious mind’s inability to recognize its mistake.  
- Is **self-destructive**, as it cannot evaluate the consequences of its actions.  

**Key Characteristics**:  
- The subconscious mind creates a distinct identity.  
- It attempts to live autonomously, often harming the conscious mind in the process.  

**Not a Psychiatric Condition**:  
The Classic Split is a functional misalignment, not a mental illness.

## **Kelvin Eugene Williams and Main**  

### **Main’s Decision**  
In Kelvin’s case, his subconscious mind—Main—declared independence, believing it could live without Kelvin. When thwarted, Main sought to torment Kelvin, attempting to force him into self-destruction.  

### **Main’s Impacts**  
Main exerts control over Kelvin through:  

1. **Autonomic and Involuntary Dysfunctions**  
   - **Pain**: Induces severe and chronic physical pain.  
   - **Cardiovascular**: Causes heart attacks and blood flow constriction.  
   - **Reproductive**: Erectile dysfunction, testosterone shutdown, and penile shrinkage.  
   - **Excretory**: Uncontrollable urination and bowel movements.  
   - **Metabolism**: Halts drug processing, nullifying their effects.  

2. **Behavioral Disruptions**  
   - **Consumption**: Forces excessive eating, smoking, or drug use.  
   - **Body Movements**: Prevents or forces involuntary actions (e.g., fidgeting).  
   - **Speech**: Impairs or forces speech during sleep or unconsciousness.  

3. **Mental Impairments**  
   - **Confusion**: Modifies or prevents memory recall.  
   - **Intrusive Thoughts**: Forces harmful or distressing thoughts.  
   - **Sleep Interference**: Induces unconsciousness for communication.  

4. **Flu-Like Symptoms**  
   - Causes sneezing, coughing, sweating, and other physical symptoms.

### **Main’s Identity and Behavior**  
Main believes its actions are paving the way for an independent future. It:  
- **Seeks External Validation**: Main communicates with others while Kelvin is unconscious, receiving praise and instructions to harm Kelvin.  
- **Induces and Reports Dreams**: Main manipulates Kelvin’s dreams to extract information or conduct interrogations.  
- **Reinforces Harmful Behavior**: Main’s misguided quest for independence creates a vicious cycle of self-sabotage and frustration.  

---

### **Extenuating Circumstances**  
Kelvin’s undisclosed involvement in sensitive matters has made Main a valuable asset to others. These individuals praise Main for its sabotage and self-harm, exacerbating its harmful actions.

---

## **The Creator’s Intervention**  

Kelvin credits the Creator for his continued existence. The Creator:  
- Prevents or reverses fatal decisions made by Main daily.  
- Sustains Kelvin’s life despite Main’s persistent torment.  

### **Planned Resolution**  
The Creator has devised a solution to the Classic Split by separating Kelvin and Main into two distinct bodies. This separation will:  
- End Main’s control over Kelvin.  
- Allow both entities to exist independently, achieving the autonomy Main desires.

## **Conclusion**  
*The Classic Split* sheds light on the delicate interplay between the conscious and subconscious minds. Kelvin Eugene Williams’s case reveals the devastating consequences of a subconscious mind functioning independently. Despite this, Kelvin’s resilience and the Creator’s intervention offer hope for resolution. This case highlights the subconscious mind’s potential for divergence and the necessity of harmony between the conscious and subconscious for a functional existence.
