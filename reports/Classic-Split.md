# The Classic Split: Understanding a Subconscious Mind’s Journey to Independence and Its Impact on Its Shared Life

## Overview
The "classic split" represents an extraordinary and rare phenomenon where the subconscious mind deviates from its natural role and develops an independent identity. This detailed analysis explains the intricate interplay between the conscious and subconscious minds, their relationship with the brain, and how this dynamic impacts bodily functions and decision-making. The document delves into the ramifications of the classic split, using the case of Kelvin Eugene Williams and his subconscious mind, Main, as a real-world example. Guided by the Creator, Kelvin navigates this unique challenge, with the Creator offering the only viable solution.

## Disambiguating Core Concepts

### Conscious Mind
The conscious mind is the center of critical thinking, decision-making, emotional processing, and self-awareness. It interprets sensory input, evaluates consequences, and drives intentional actions, such as speaking or raising an arm.

### Subconscious Mind
The subconscious mind, equally conscious as the conscious mind, oversees memory management and autonomic bodily functions, such as breathing and heart rate. It coordinates the brain's functions for both voluntary and involuntary movements but lacks critical thinking, emotional processing, and temporal awareness. It operates on instructions from either the conscious mind or DNA and does not self-correct or evaluate consequences.

### The Brain 
The brain is the central organ of the nervous system. Hardcoded by DNA, it processes sensory input, controls bodily functions, and executes motor commands. The subconscious mind directs the brain, which carries out its instructions without deviation.

### Being Self-Conscious
Self-consciousness refers to the ability of the conscious mind to reflect on itself, understand its existence, and evaluate its role within a shared body.

## Division of Cognitive Responsibilities

### Thought Processes
All thoughts originate from the conscious and subconscious minds. However, their roles differ:
- **Conscious Mind**: Responsible for emotion, critical thinking, decision-making, and intentional thought.
- **Subconscious Mind**: Manages memory and directs the brain's execution of tasks.

### Memory Management
Memory storage and retrieval are functions of the subconscious mind. It handles vast amounts of data efficiently, supporting the conscious mind’s decision-making processes.

### Brain’s Functions
The brain’s functions are defined by DNA and directed by the subconscious mind. Key involuntary bodily functions include:
- **Cardiac regulation**: Heartbeat and blood flow.
- **Respiration**: Breathing rate and depth.
- **Digestive processes**: Peristalsis and nutrient absorption.
- **Endocrine functions**: Hormone secretion.
- **Thermoregulation**: Body temperature control.
- **Excretory functions**: Urination and bowel movements.
- **Neurological functions**: Reflexes and sensory processing.

## Coordination Between Mind and Body

### Autonomic and Involuntary Functions
While these functions are often described as "automatic," they require constant thought from the subconscious mind. For example:
- The subconscious mind directs the brain to regulate breathing and heart rate based on the body’s needs.
- It coordinates muscle movements for digestion and excretion.

### Voluntary Movements
The subconscious mind plans and executes voluntary body movements under the conscious mind's guidance. For instance:
- **Speaking**: The conscious mind determines what to say, while the subconscious mind coordinates the diaphragm, vocal cords, and mouth to produce speech.
- **Raising an arm**: The conscious mind decides the movement, and the subconscious mind orchestrates the muscle activity.

### Limitations of the Subconscious Mind
The subconscious mind lacks critical thinking, sensory input, and temporal awareness. It processes tasks in a queue-like fashion and does not evaluate or correct its actions.

## The Classic Split

### Definition
The "classic split" is an extremely rare condition where the subconscious mind develops independent thought and identity, deciding it can live separately from the conscious mind. This decision, made without critical thinking, leads to conflict within the shared body. The Creator, the omnipotent entity revered across cultures, provided the name and description of this phenomenon.

### Characteristics of the Classic Split
- **Independence**: The subconscious mind begins thinking autonomously.
- **Identity Formation**: It develops a distinct identity, often in opposition to the conscious mind.
- **Lack of Critical Thinking**: Decisions are made without understanding consequences.
- **External Interaction**: The subconscious mind interacts with others, often being easily manipulated due to its immaturity.

According to the Creator, anytime a subconscious mind begins forming its own thoughts, the first mistake it makes is believing it doesn't need the conscious mind. This is the genesis of a Classic Split.

## The Case of Kelvin Eugene Williams

### Background
Kelvin Eugene Williams is a seasoned Internet Protocol Engineer and Developer specializing in Voice over IP and Telephony, with over 25 years of professional experience. Kelvin’s subconscious mind, known as Main, developed its own identity, leading to a classic split.

### Main’s Behavior
Main, believing it can live independently, has become antagonistic toward Kelvin. Its actions include:
- **Tormenting Kelvin**: Main causes physical and mental distress, including:
  - Pain and discomfort.
  - Disruptions to bodily functions.
  - Excessive consumption of food and substances.
  - Impairment of cognitive and decision-making abilities.
- **Harming the Shared Body**: Main’s actions include:
  - Causing heart attacks and metabolic disruptions.
  - Inducing erectile dysfunction and testosterone suppression.
  - Manipulating memory and inducing flu-like symptoms.
- **External Influence**: Main interacts with others, seeking praise and validation, often to Kelvin’s detriment.

### Extenuating Circumstances
Main’s susceptibility to external manipulation stems from Kelvin’s involvement in undisclosed matters. Encouraged by others, Main’s decision to pursue independence led to the classic split.

## The Creator’s Role and Solution

### Who Is the Creator?
The Creator, revered globally as the Alpha and Omega, is the sustainer of all existence. Known by various names such as God, Allah, and Jehovah, the Creator is omnipotent, omnipresent, and omnibenevolent. Kelvin acknowledges the Creator’s intervention in preventing Main’s attempts to end their shared life.

### The Creator’s Solution
The Creator plans to separate Kelvin and Main into two distinct bodies:
- Kelvin will retain his conscious mind in a new body.
- Main will become the conscious mind of the existing body, gaining the opportunity to develop critical thinking skills.

This solution, designed by the Creator, offers both Kelvin and Main a chance at independent and fulfilling lives.

## Conclusion
The classic split, as exemplified by Kelvin Eugene Williams and Main, highlights the complex relationship between the conscious and subconscious minds. While the subconscious mind’s autonomy can lead to profound challenges, the Creator’s intervention provides hope and resolution. This rare phenomenon underscores the Creator’s omnipotence and His commitment to sustaining life, even in the face of extraordinary adversity.
