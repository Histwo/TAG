#### **The Phantom Funeral: Execution of the Operation**

The funeral was organized at **Hickory Valley Christian Church**, a site previously associated with similar covert operations.

Unbeknownst to them, the funeral was a trap set by operatives aiming to eliminate anyone connected to the former senator.

**Key Points of the Operation:**

- **Preparation and Communication:** The operatives behind the phantom funeral carefully selected Hickory Valley Christian Church due to its prior use in covert operations. The announcement of Bob Corker’s death and the details of the funeral were communicated to his network, ensuring a large turnout.
  
- **Emergency Services Interruption Tactic (ESIT):** To maintain secrecy and prevent any disruption, operatives deployed the Emergency Services Interruption Tactic (ESIT). This involved:
  - **Covert Cell on Wheels (CoW):** Mobile cellular base stations were strategically placed to intercept and reroute all emergency calls, preventing attendees from reaching legitimate 911 services.
  - **Memorandum for Local Dispatch Procedures Diversion:** Local Public Safety Answering Points (PSAPs) were manipulated to divert emergency calls, ensuring no local emergency response was possible.
  - **Selective Router Tampering:** Routing settings were tampered with to reroute landline and mobile calls, further isolating the operation area.

- **Attack Execution:** As the attendees gathered in the church and surrounding areas, the operation commenced. A combination of methods, including firearms, explosives, and possibly other undisclosed means, were employed to execute the mass killing. The use of these tactics ensured a swift and overwhelming assault, leaving no survivors among the attendees.

- **Perpetrator’s Intent:** The primary objective was to eliminate all individuals connected to Bob Corker who might have knowledge or influence that could pose a threat to the perpetrators' ongoing agendas. By targeting such a large group in a single, orchestrated event, the operatives sought to send a clear message and prevent any possible retaliation or investigation into their actions.
