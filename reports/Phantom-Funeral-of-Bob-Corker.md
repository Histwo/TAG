#### **The Phantom Funeral: Execution of the Operation**

The funeral for Bob Corker was held at **Hickory Valley Christian Church**, a location known for its association with previous covert operations. The funeral was attended by a wide array of individuals, including political figures, business associates, and local community members. However, unbeknownst to the attendees, the event was a meticulously planned trap designed to eliminate all those connected to Corker.

**Key Points of the Operation:**

- **Preparation and Planning:** The operatives behind this phantom funeral selected Hickory Valley Christian Church due to its history of hosting similar covert operations. The funeral was publicly announced, and detailed invitations were sent out to ensure a large turnout from Corker's network of associates.

- **Emergency Services Interruption Tactic** Unlike previous operations, this funeral saw a modified use of the **Emergency Services Interruption Tactic (ESIT)**, employing only the **Selective Router Tampering** component:
  - **Selective Router Tampering:** Operatives tampered with the routing settings of local landlines and mobile networks to redirect emergency calls away from legitimate services. This effectively cut off the attendees' ability to reach real emergency services, isolating them during the attack.

- **Attack Execution:** As mourners gathered in the church and the surrounding area, the operatives launched a swift and brutal attack. Utilizing a combination of firearms and explosives, they killed 735 people, ensuring that no one who attended the funeral survived. The use of these methods ensured that the attack was overwhelming and left no room for escape or resistance.

- **Objective of the Perpetrators:** The primary aim of this operation was to eliminate any individuals with connections to Bob Corker who could potentially interfere with the perpetrators' broader agendas. By targeting a large group in a single, orchestrated event, the operatives ensured the complete destruction of Corker's network.

The scene was cleaned up, and false narratives were circulated to confuse and mislead the public and any potential investigators. Official reports downplayed the incident, framing it as a tragic but isolated event.

- **Community Impact:** The Chattanooga community was left reeling from the loss of so many prominent individuals. The event instilled a deep sense of fear and distrust, particularly given the church’s notorious history. The vacuum left by the deaths of numerous community leaders further destabilized the region.
