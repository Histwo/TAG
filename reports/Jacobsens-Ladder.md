# Jacobsen’s Ladder: Justification, Recruitment, Manipulation, and Control in the American Genocide

## 1. Introduction

This report examines the uses of Jacobsen's Ladder, a litmus test employed by perpetrators of the genocide to determine if the Creator (known as God in the United States) will intervene in their actions against churches. Kelvin Eugene Williams, one of the Creator's two servants and a cherubim (or angel to those who call Him God), is central to this investigation. The report explores how Jacobsen and her team manipulate Kelvin's subconscious, Main, to carry out these actions, including the deliberate reduction of Kelvin's penile size and attempts to silence him.

Kelvin Eugene Williams, one of the Creator’s two servants, is known as one of the cherubim or an angel to those who call Him God. This report examines the systematic targeting, elimination, and mind control efforts directed towards Kelvin, focusing on the tactics used by Annie Jacobsen and her associates within the CIA. Kelvin's subconscious, named Main, is also discussed as a significant factor in these efforts. All subconsciouses are conscious, and Main is the name Kelvin’s subconscious gave itself after the Hypnos Infiltration Method was performed by in-person practitioners in Kelvin's home while he slept, which is utilized and performed over the airwaves in television programming, popular music of all genres, and sometimes on a target in person while they sleep. This initiative is part of a larger plan to justify, recruit, manipulate, and control individuals, perpetuating acts of genocide within the United States. Kelvin is the last and only living member of Mount Calvary Baptist Church, which was attacked by Jacobsen, also known as "Hurricane Annie," on April 2nd, 2023. Kelvin hadn't been inside the church, although still a member, for more than 30 years.

## 2. Historical Context

### 2.1 Origin in the 1980s

The efforts to establish an authoritarian regime in the United States began in the 1980s, with political elites exploring ways to consolidate power and diminish the influence of potential opposition.

### 2.2 Escalation in 2022

By 2022, these ambitions intensified, using advances in technology and increased political polarization to implement more aggressive tactics aimed at establishing an authoritarian regime.

## 3. Jacobsen’s Ladder Usages

### 3.1 Justification

Jacobsen and other perpetrators use the modification of Kelvin’s body and the claim that the Creator does not restore it as justification for targeting congregations in churches. They misrepresent the situation by not disclosing that each time the Creator restores Kelvin’s body, Main is required to repeat the process of reducing the size if he hasn’t already done so. Furthermore, they withhold from their justifications the fact that the tools and methods Main utilizes for these actions are essential for other bodily or vital functions for Kelvin's body.

Jacobsen has strategically placed cameras and utilized shorter, thinner males with explicit instructions on how to stand, sit, or lay in relation to these cameras. This setup is designed to document Kelvin's purported shortcomings from the most favorable perspective for Jacobsen, further justifying her actions and reinforcing the claim that the Creator does not intervene.

### 3.2 Recruiting

Jacobsen exploits Main's programming to discredit Kelvin's divine connection, claiming that no true servant of the Creator could endure such manipulation. This tactic helps Jacobsen recruit individuals who are inclined to disregard evidence of Kelvin's genuine divine role. Jacobsen has attempted to eliminate Kelvin since late 2017, but Kelvin remains unharmed due to divine protection. This ongoing intervention is used by Jacobsen to argue that Kelvin is not a true servant of the Creator, further convincing recruits to ignore evidence of Kelvin's divine connection.

### 3.3 Discrediting Kelvin

Jacobsen has circulated inflated penile measurements attributed to Kelvin—up to 17 inches—to discredit him. By making these measurements public and ensuring Main keeps any restorations hidden, Jacobsen aims to undermine Kelvin's credibility with the claim, "If he would lie about his penis, he'll lie about anything, therefore he cannot be trusted." This tactic is also used to suppress Kelvin's reports on Jacobsen’s activities and the broader genocide.

### 3.4 Controlling Kelvin

Jacobsen uses code words and phrases, developed with Main during Hypnos infiltration, to control his actions. Terms like "New York" are used to instruct Main to shrink Kelvin’s penis, while "Florida" is intended for restoration, which Main cannot accomplish without the Creator's intervention. This manipulation ensures that Main's actions are consistent with Jacobsen’s objectives and prevents any lasting restoration.

## 4. Exegesis for Revelation 17:9-11

**Revelation 17:9-11 (ESV):**
“This calls for a mind with wisdom: the seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman is seated. They are also seven kings, five of whom have fallen, one is, the other has not yet come; and when he does come, he must remain only a little while. As for the beast that was and is not, it is an eighth but belongs to the seven, and it goes to destruction.”

### Glossary

- **Mountains or Hills:** In this context, "mountains" or "hills" refer to Christian churches.
- **Kings:** Refers to well-endowed males.
- **Heads:** Represents imperial inches, a unit used to gauge penile length.

### Exegesis

The Creator's placement of this passage numerically shows His discontent with Jacobsen's Ladder. Chapter 17 refers to her arbitrary measurement which she circulated amongst others. Verses 9-11 refer to the North American emergency number 9-1-1, which is interrupted when the CIA and federal government orchestrate these attacks on seated congregations.

Revelation 17:9-11 is interpreted in this context as follows:

- **“This calls for a mind with wisdom”**: This phrase refers to Main, who is characterized by a lack of critical thinking ability and is manipulated by Jacobsen.

- **“The seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman is seated”**: Here, "seven heads" symbolize the seven inches that Jacobsen demands, encourages, entices, and rewards Main for maintaining Kelvin’s penile size at or below. Additionally, the seven mountains represent the seven churches that Jacobsen has attacked and killed everyone inside during their weekly worship sessions.

- **“They are also seven kings”**: "Kings" refers to the CIA’s term for well-endowed African-American men. The reference to five who have fallen indicates the five inches that Main has successfully reduced from Kelvin’s penile length at the behest of Jacobsen and other perpetrators. 

- **“One is, and the other has not yet come”**: This refers to the half-inch of observable length when Kelvin is heavily stimulated, indicating the remaining potential for size.

- **“As for the beast that was and is not, it is an eighth but belongs to the seven, and it goes to destruction”**: This describes the subconscious mind in Kelvin’s body, Main. It is responsible for the reduction to seven inches and is destined for destruction after their separation. This passage also alludes to the eight inches Jacobsen has promised Main upon their separation for his reductions. The separation is the planned division of Main and Kelvin into two distinct bodies by the Creator.

## 5. Conclusion

Jacobsen's Ladder serves as a multifaceted tool for justification, recruitment, discrediting, and controlling efforts within the framework of the genocide. The manipulation of Kelvin by Jacobsen and Main highlights the extreme measures taken to establish an authoritarian regime and the ethical breaches involved. Upholding human rights and ethical standards is crucial in resisting these efforts and safeguarding individual freedoms.
