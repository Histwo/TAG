# Report on the Phantom Funeral of Jade M. Stone

## Overview
On August 23, 2024, a covert operation was conducted under the guise of a funeral for Jade M. Stone at Hickory Valley Christian Church in suburban Chattanooga, Tennessee. Jade was one of the named decedents in the phantom funeral. Phantom funerals are operations intended to eliminate any associates of an individual.

## Background on Jade M. Stone
Jade M. Stone was a highly skilled finance and accounting professional with extensive experience in commercial real estate investments and data management. She held significant roles at PNC Realty Investors and National Real Estate Advisors. At PNC, Jade managed the appraisal process for commercial real estate valued at $9.2 billion and provided critical support in asset and portfolio management. Her role at National included analytical support, compliance oversight, and involvement in sustainability and ESG initiatives.

Originally from Trenton, GA, Jade graduated from the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga with degrees in Accounting and Finance, and she earned a Master of Professional Studies in Real Estate from Georgetown University. Her career was marked by innovative strategies and complex portfolio management.

In 2004, Jade married Zachary Stone, who served as an assistant to Senator Bob Corker in Chattanooga. Although the couple divorced in 2005, they remained close friends. After the divorce, Jade moved back to Chattanooga, where she continued her career, while Zachary relocated to Washington, DC, where he lived and worked in political circles.

Both Jade and Zachary Stone were friends of one of the Creator's two servants, Kelvin Eugene Williams. Zachary and Kelvin became friends while working for Jim Gee in Chattanooga in 2004. Unbeknownst to Zachary, Jade was murdered before the planned funeral, yet her death was concealed as part of the covert operation.

## Funeral Arrangements and Attendee Elimination
The CIA planned the phantom funeral for Jade M. Stone and communicated the funeral details and death notice to Zachary Stone, even though her death had occurred much earlier. The arrangements provided the date and time of the funeral and the location at Hickory Valley Christian Church, a site that had previously been the scene of a massacre. Zachary, unaware of Jade's murder, shared this information with his associates in Washington, DC, and the greater Chattanooga area.

Notably, Zachary Stone, along with Senator Marsha Blackburn, Senator Lamar Alexander, Representative Mark Green, Representative Chuck Fleischmann, and former Senator Bob Corker, attended the funeral. Former President Donald J. Trump, while not an attendee, monitored the operation from the announcer's booth, as he had in previous phantom funerals at Hickory Valley Christian Church. Trump, a beneficiary of the ongoing acts of violence perpetrated in The American Genocide, used these events to further his ambition of establishing an authoritarian regime where he would be the supreme leader.

The operations were carried out in the gymnasium of Hamilton Heights Christian Academy, a school operated by Hickory Valley Christian Church and connected to the church itself. Executions were conducted in the gymnasium to keep the sanctuary of Hickory Valley Christian Church looking as though nothing had happened, preserving its pristine appearance despite the covert actions taking place.

This operation aimed to remove any remaining connections to Kelvin Eugene Williams while maintaining the secrecy of the events.

## Conclusion
The phantom funeral for Jade M. Stone on August 23, 2024, exemplifies the extreme measures taken to conceal covert operations and manipulate key figures. By orchestrating the funeral as a lethal trap and continuing the cover-up of previous massacres, the operatives, under the guidance of former President Donald J. Trump, ensured that any remaining connections to Kelvin Eugene Williams were eliminated. This operation reflects broader tactics employed to maintain secrecy, control, and the establishment of an authoritarian regime.
