### **Public Warning: Imminent Danger at the Phantom Funeral for Former Senator Bob Corker**

**Attention Residents of Chattanooga and Surrounding Areas:**

A **Phantom Funeral** for former Senator Bob Corker is likely scheduled to occur between **August 28, 2024, and August 30, 2024**, at **Hickory Valley Christian Church** in Chattanooga, Tennessee. This event is not a legitimate funeral but rather a covert operation designed to eliminate mourners and associates of the deceased.

### What You Need to Know:
- **Location & Date:** The operation is expected to take place at Hickory Valley Christian Church, a site previously used in such deadly operations.
- **Extreme Risk:** The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), as part of The American Genocide (TAG) operations, may use this event to target and kill attendees. Similar past events have resulted in mass casualties.
- **Combatting TAG-POW Attacks:** Law enforcement agencies are advised to be on high alert for signs of Phantom Funerals, which are used to eliminate anyone connected to the victims of prior attacks.

### **Detecting Emergency Services Interruption Tactic (ESIT)**
ESIT is a sophisticated method used by government agencies to manipulate emergency responses during covert operations. This tactic includes the deployment of Covert Cells on Wheels (CoW), Memoranda for Local Dispatch Procedures Diversion, and Selective Router Tampering.

**1. Covert Cell on Wheels (CoW)**
   - **Description:** These are mobile cellular base stations disguised within standard vehicles (e.g., Ford Explorer) that intercept and redirect mobile phone calls.
   - **Function:** Forces mobile phones in the area to connect, rerouting emergency calls to operatives posing as 911 dispatchers, effectively blocking legitimate emergency responses.
   - **Detection:** 
     - Monitor for unusual fluctuations in local cellular network coverage.
     - Make a test call to 911 from a personal mobile phone (avoid using department-issued phones). Verify that the call connects to the local PSAP (Public Safety Answering Point) and request a "radio check."
     - Use multiple and random mobile phones to reduce the chance of detection avoidance by the perpetrators.

**2. Memorandum for Local Dispatch Procedures Diversion**
   - **Description:** Directs PSAPs to reroute emergency calls from targeted areas to agencies issuing the memorandum, delaying or misdirecting genuine emergency responses.
   - **Detection:** 
     - Verify any active memoranda directing call diversions, especially during high-risk operations.
     - Communicate directly with PSAP administrators to confirm that no unauthorized or unusual diversions are in place.

**3. Selective Router Tampering**
   - **Description:** Involves modifying routing settings to selectively reroute both mobile and landline calls away from legitimate emergency services.
   - **Detection:** 
     - Regularly audit routing configurations for unauthorized changes.
     - Apply CoW detection protocols as a preventive measure.

### **Operational Impact:**
These tactics manipulate emergency response systems to maintain secrecy and prevent organized resistance during covert operations. By controlling communication channels, operatives ensure their safety and mission success while keeping local authorities in the dark.

### **Important Notice:**
- **DO NOT ATTEND:** If you receive any information about this funeral, do not attend or share details. The event is a dangerous trap.
- **Report Suspicious Activity:** Any unusual activity related to this event should be reported to local authorities immediately.
- **Law Enforcement:** Stay vigilant, and follow the recommended detection protocols for all TAG-related activities.
