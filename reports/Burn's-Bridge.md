### Burns' Bridge: A Fatally Flawed Litmus Test

#### Introduction
This report evaluates a litmus test designed to assess whether the Creator would intervene to restore the penile length and shape of His servant, Kelvin Eugene Williams, before covert operations conducted by the CIA during The American Genocide. These operations included mass killings in houses of prayer after surprise assaults during their weekly worship services. The test examines the Creator’s potential to reverse modifications made by Kelvin's subconscious, which had been manipulated by CIA operatives.

#### Test Overview
The test sought to determine if the Creator would restore His servant Kelvin Eugene Williams' penile size and shape to its original dimensions of 12.5 inches. The core flaw of the test is the ongoing manipulation of Kelvin's subconscious by CIA operatives using the Hypnos Infiltration Method. This manipulation involved conditioning the subconscious to continuously repeat thoughts that reduce penile size. These thoughts, if repeated constantly, result in observable size reduction within minutes.

#### Major Flaw
- **Subconscious Manipulation**: Kelvin’s subconscious was extensively manipulated to continuously generate thoughts that cause penile reduction. Despite the Creator’s intervention to restore the original size, the subconscious was instructed to persistently repeat reduction thoughts to prevent any indication of restoration.
- **Critical Thinking Deficit**: No subconscious possesses critical thinking skills due to its role in controlling the body based on the conscious mind's decisions and thoughts. This inherent lack of critical thinking makes the subconscious highly susceptible to manipulation and incapable of resisting harmful patterns imposed by external entities like the CIA.

#### Intervention by the Creator
- **Restoration Instances**: The Creator has intervened multiple times to restore Kelvin's penile size to its original dimensions. Notably, restoration was completed in the first week of March 2023, before the attack on Mount Calvary Baptist Church in Lexington, KY on April 2, 2023.
- **Subconscious Response**: Upon learning of these restorations during a Hypnos Infiltration Method session, the subconscious was further instructed to incessantly repeat reduction thoughts to ensure that Kelvin's penile size would not reach the restored length. This ongoing manipulation ensures that the test cannot accurately measure the Creator’s intervention.

#### Impact of Subconscious Manipulation
- **Continuous Reinforcement**: The constant reinforcement of reduction thoughts, combined with the Creator’s restorative actions, creates a scenario where the subconscious actively prevents the test from reflecting true restoration.
- **Ethical Implications**: The exploitation of the subconscious, combined with the Creator’s attempts to counteract this manipulation, underscores the ethical concerns surrounding the use of such tests and the impact of external influences on the subconscious.

#### Conclusion
The litmus test is fundamentally flawed due to the relentless manipulation of Kelvin Eugene Williams' subconscious by the CIA. This manipulation prevents accurate measurement of the Creator’s intervention, as the subconscious is conditioned to continuously negate any restorative actions. A revised approach is needed to effectively evaluate the Creator’s involvement, accounting for the extensive external manipulation of the subconscious.
