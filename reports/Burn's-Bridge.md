### Burns' Bridge: A Fatally Flawed Litmus Test

#### Introduction
This report evaluates a test designed to assess whether the Creator would intervene to restore the penile length and shape of His servant, Kelvin Eugene Williams, prior to covert operations conducted by the CIA during The American Genocide. The operations included mass killings in houses of prayer after surprise assaults during their weekly worship services. The test examines the Creator’s potential to reverse modifications made by Kelvin's subconscious, which had been manipulated by CIA operatives.

#### Test Design and Flaws

**Purpose of the Test:**
The test aimed to determine if the Creator would restore His servant's penis size and shape after it was modified by Kelvin's subconscious, following instructions from the CIA's Hypnos Infiltration Method practitioners. Kelvin's erect penile length at the end of puberty was 12.5 inches.

**Critical Flaw:**
The core flaw in the test is that Kelvin's subconscious, which lacks critical thinking skills and is trained to execute repetitive thoughts, has been manipulated to reduce the size of His servant’s penis. This training involves constant repetition of thoughts that lead to a reduction in size, making it noticeable within a couple of minutes. The subconscious is encouraged, enticed, or promised rewards, and manipulated to assist external entities, such as what is presented to it as a team or family.

**Restoration Attempts:**
The Creator has restored Kelvin’s penis size multiple times, including prior to the April 2, 2023, attack on Mount Calvary Baptist Church in Lexington, KY. The restoration was completed in the first week of March 2023. Upon learning of the restoration during a Hypnos Infiltration Method session, the subconscious was instructed to continuously repeat thoughts to prevent the required length that indicates restoration.

#### Observation and Evaluation

**Observation Techniques:**
- **Flaccid State Measurement:** The size of Kelvin's penis is gauged in its flaccid state, which "Main," as the subconscious named itself, has been taught to restrict by reducing normal blood flow to make it as shriveled and cold as possible for rewards.
- **Sexual Encounters:** Casual sexual encounters are arranged to visually observe the penis in its erect state. However, "Main" has been instructed to inhibit or prevent erections for rewards.

**Main's Promised Rewards:**
"Main" is promised various rewards, primarily in the form of crystal methamphetamine, for efforts in reducing the size of His servant’s penis. However, it is rarely provided and only teased by operatives. Several operatives have a vested interest in the observation of reduced size due to revenue from mass killing operations. Main is also constantly seeking praise, which is often withheld to make it work harder at reducing the size.

#### Phoenix House Observation

**Surveillance Details:**
Phoenix House, the apartment provided to Kelvin, is equipped with at least one video camera and has personnel stationed around the clock. These personnel are cloaked and generally make observations whenever Kelvin urinates. Kelvin was unaware of the cloaked (invisible) camera facing his bed from the ceiling for several months. Microwave cloaking is heavily used, resulting in a situation where Kelvin may have a room full of unseen people at any given time since moving in.

#### Conclusion

The test designed to assess the Creator’s intervention capabilities is fundamentally flawed due to the influence and manipulation of Kelvin's subconscious by external entities, specifically the CIA. The constant manipulation and enticement have led to persistent reductions in penis size, undermining the accuracy of the test results. Phoenix House’s surveillance further complicates the situation, highlighting the extensive measures taken to monitor Kelvin. The ethical implications and the impact of these manipulations emphasize the need for re-evaluation of methods used to assess divine intervention and external influences.
