## Report on the Phantom Funeral of Senator Marsha Blackburn

**Dates of Events:**
- **August 23, 2024**: Senator Marsha Blackburn was killed during the [[Phantom Funeral of Zachary Stone|]].
- **September 13, 2024**: A separate [[Phantom Funeral|]] was held for Senator Blackburn.

### Overview

Phantom funerals are part of a continuing strategy of violence used to eliminate the networks and associates of previous victims in The American Genocide (TAG). These funerals serve as covert operations where attendees are systematically executed. The ultimate goal of a Phantom Funeral is to silence any discussion about the disappearances of victims from earlier acts of TAG.

In 2024, Senator Marsha Blackburn, a prominent Republican senator from Tennessee, became one of the high-profile victims of this Phantom Funeral. Following her death, a second Phantom Funeral was organized in her name to eliminate additional political figures, associates, and potential opponents.

### Senator Marsha Blackburn's Death: August 23, 2024

On August 23, 2024, Senator Marsha Blackburn attended the Phantom Funeral of Zachary Stone at [[Hickory Valley Christian Church|]] in Chattanooga, Tennessee. This event, like others in the pattern of Phantom Funerals during [[TAG|]], was carefully orchestrated by the CIA to covertly execute mourners. Initially, sentenced inmates were designated to carry out the killings. Blackburn, along with other attendees, was killed during this brutal operation.

At these funerals, mourners are typically seated in a sanctuary awaiting the start of services. Inmate operatives then launch a surprise assault, capturing small groups and taking them to the gymnasium of the adjacent Hamilton Heights Christian Academy. Executions are carried out to ensure the death of the victims and maintain the secrecy of the operation.

### Phantom Funeral for Marsha Blackburn: September 13, 2024

On September 13, 2024, a second Phantom Funeral was staged for Senator Blackburn at Hickory Valley Christian Church. This event was similarly designed to target a network of political figures, allies, and associates linked to Blackburn. Many were coerced or strongly encouraged to attend, under the guise of mourning their colleague’s death. Instead, it became a staged execution.

The CIA had a list of individuals to eliminate at this event, using the typical covert methodology of employing sentenced inmates to execute the mourners. However, as the operation unfolded, a change in tactics occurred.

### Shift in Tactics Due to Fear of Creator’s Intervention

Present at the September 13 funeral were several high-profile figures, including President Joe Biden, former President Donald Trump, Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, and CIA Director William Burns. Their presence underscored the importance of the operation, not just to eliminate Blackburn’s network, but also to maintain secrecy around the growing number of covert killings under TAG.

Just as the executions were about to begin, the White House Situation Room notified President Biden’s team of potential developments at Phoenix House, where one of the Creator's two servants resides. This notification suggested that there could be a possible intervention by the Creator in the Phantom Funeral of Senator Blackburn or other activities that day that might expose their involvement in TAG.

Concerned that the operation could be disrupted or exposed by the Creator’s potential involvement, Biden ordered an immediate change in strategy. He directed the Secret Service to take over the execution process.

Instead of the typical inmate-led operation, Secret Service agents assembled a firing squad in the gymnasium to carry out the executions as quickly as possible. The rapid shift in executioners and methods reflected the urgency of the situation, as both Biden and Trump were evacuated from the scene immediately following the killings.

### Collapse of the Gymnasium

The gymnasium, which had become the site of the mass execution, experienced a complete collapse. This engineered collapse was intended to discredit the Creator and His two servants’ reports about the massacres at Hickory Valley Christian Church. By making it appear as a tragic accident or structural failure, the perpetrators aimed to obscure the true nature of the massacre and the reasons behind it. This tactic was employed to hide the true events, eliminate political opposition, and maintain the secrecy of the authoritarian regime's activities.

### Handling of Autopsies

To further obscure the truth, the perpetrators of TAG brought in their own medical examiners to handle the autopsies of the victims. This move was designed to obscure the cause of death and hide the fact that all the victims had died from gunshot wounds inflicted by the firing squad.

### Conclusion

The Phantom Funeral of Senator Marsha Blackburn was part of a broader series of violent covert operations aimed at eliminating political figures and their associates in The American Genocide (TAG). Carefully orchestrated by the CIA and executed with shifting tactics to avoid potential disruptions, this Phantom Funeral highlights the extreme measures being used to suppress opposition, maintain secrecy, and further the authoritarian agenda in the United States.

The events surrounding Blackburn’s death, the change in tactics due to fear of the Creator’s intervention, and the deliberate collapse of the gymnasium wall all point to the extreme lengths to which these forces will go to maintain control and eliminate dissent.
