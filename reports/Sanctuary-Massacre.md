# Sanctuary Massacres  

Sanctuary Massacres refer to a series of covert mass 
executions carried out during **The American Genocide 
 ([[TAG|]])**. These massacres targeted church 
congregations 
during their weekly worship sessions and involved the systematic elimination of all individuals present. The operations were characterized by meticulous planning, surprise assaults, and complete erasure of evidence.  

## Overview  

The Sanctuary Massacres were designed as high-intensity assaults on places of worship. Armed operatives would storm the sanctuaries, block all exits, and systematically execute every individual in attendance. Anyone attempting to escape was met with force. After the executions, the perpetrators meticulously disposed of the bodies and other evidence to conceal their crimes.  

### Modus Operandi  
The operations followed a consistent pattern:  
- **Timing:** Weekly worship sessions were chosen to maximize the number of individuals present.  
- **Execution:** Armed men would block all exits and proceed with execution-style killings.  
- **Weapons:** Weapons varied by assault, including handguns and chainsaws.  
- **Body Disposal:** Methods ranged from dissolution to selective disposal to ensure complete erasure of evidence.  

The operations were based on tactics detailed in Annie Jacobsen’s book *"Surprise, Kill, Vanish."* Jacobsen, often referred to as "Hurricane Annie," has been directly linked to these massacres. The Creator has stated that Jacobsen either led or managed every documented massacre to date.

### Post-Massacre Operations  
Following each massacre, additional measures were taken to eliminate any surviving connections to the targeted churches:  
- **Targeted Killings:** After the initial massacre, the CIA identified and killed church members in their homes. Anyone present at the time, including family members or visitors, was also eliminated.  
- **Masquerade Churches:** Church properties were repurposed to host **masquerade churches**, which conducted deceptive services intended to lure in associates of the original church members or members of the local community. These individuals were subsequently identified and eliminated.  

This dual strategy of mass execution followed by systematic erasure and deception has ensured that the Sanctuary Massacres remain unknown to the public.
