According to the Creator, TAG is unequivocally a genocide. The desires of the political elite to establish an authoritarian regime in the US are now advancing this genocide, which they deem necessary to eliminate opposition to authoritarianism. An undercurrent of authoritarianism, political agendas, and narrow viewpoints is fueling this hidden genocide. Ending it requires direct intervention from Him. As part of this intervention, the Creator has entrusted His servants with information about these atrocities—some of which is closely guarded or classified—to be shared with the broader public.

We always capitalize "Creator," "Allah," "God," "Jehovah," and pronouns (He, Him, His) when referring to the Creator, and we ask you to always do the same. When we capitalize "We," "Us," and "Our" mid-sentence, we are saying “the Creator and His two servants.”
