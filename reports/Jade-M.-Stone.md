# Report on the Phantom Funeral of Jade M. Stone

**Date and Location**: August 23, 2024, Hickory Valley Christian Church

The phantom funeral of Jade M. Stone, one of many named decedents, was held at the Hickory Valley Christian Church. Jade Stone's case is emblematic of the broader, covert operations conducted under the Phantom Identity Scheme and related tactics used by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to obscure the true fates of targeted individuals. This report delves into the context and implications of the phantom funeral, focusing on the techniques used to erase the existence of Jade Stone and other victims, and the broader impact of such covert operations.

#### Background on Jade M. Stone and Zachary Stone

Jade M. Stone, whose phantom funeral took place on August 23, 2024, was the ex-wife of Zachary Stone, a prominent figure in Tennessee Valley's political circles. Zachary Stone, once an assistant to Senator Bob Corker, was an up-and-coming politician in his own right. He and Jade were well-known and influential within the Republican community, often seen in Washington, D.C. Given their prominence, the disappearance and subsequent manipulation of Jade Stone's identity, along with other victims, reflects a calculated effort by the CIA to eliminate potential threats to their operations while exploiting the assets and social standings of these individuals.

#### The Phantom Funeral and Its Significance

The phantom funeral at Hickory Valley Christian Church is a stark example of how these funerals are used as part of a larger strategy to silence and eliminate potential whistleblowers and concerned individuals. Phantom funerals are not genuine memorials but are instead traps set by the CIA to ensure that anyone who might investigate or mourn the deceased can be eliminated without raising suspicion. These events are meticulously planned to appear legitimate, but they serve the darker purpose of continuing violence against those who seek the truth.

At Jade Stone's phantom funeral, several high-profile politicians, including Senator Marsha Blackburn, were also targeted and killed. This pattern of targeting influential figures further highlights the strategic intent behind these operations—to eliminate any potential resistance or inquiry into the true nature of the phantom scheme.

#### The Phantom Identity Scheme: Tactics and Technology

The Phantom Identity Scheme employed by the CIA involves a series of sophisticated techniques designed to make it appear as though the deceased individuals, or "phantoms," are still alive. The key steps include:

1. **Digital Manipulation**:
   - Maintaining the victim's social media presence and email correspondence to create the illusion of ongoing life.
  
2. **Financial Transactions**:
   - Keeping the victim's financial activities active, such as bank transactions and employment records, to avoid any suspicion of their death.

3. **Government Benefits and Insurance Fraud**:
   - Exploiting the victim’s government benefits and insurance policies under the guise of their continued existence.

4. **Public Records and Physical Impersonation**:
   - Updating identity documents and medical records, and occasionally using operatives to impersonate the deceased in brief encounters.

5. **Advanced Technology**:
   - Utilizing AI, deepfake technology, and GPS spoofing to create convincing evidence of the victim’s continued life.

These tactics ensure that the true fate of individuals like Jade M. Stone remains hidden, preventing any legal or public inquiry into their disappearance. The use of these methods by the CIA not only obscures the reality of their deaths but also enables the agency to exploit their identities and assets for covert operations.

#### Vanishing Tactics and Disposal of Remains

One of the most critical aspects of the Phantom Identity Scheme is the disposal of the victims' remains. The CIA reportedly uses techniques that ensure no trace of the bodies is left behind, making it impossible for any remains to be discovered or reported. In cases like Jade Stone's, the remains are likely disposed of in a manner that prevents any possibility of identification, leaving them merely "missing" if reported at all.

This disappearance tactic is crucial to the success of the Phantom Identity Scheme, as it removes any physical evidence that could potentially unravel the covert operations. By ensuring that the remains vanish, the CIA effectively erases the existence of the victim, allowing them to continue using the victim's identity for fraudulent activities and further covert operations without detection.

#### Conclusion

The phantom funeral of Jade M. Stone is a chilling example of the lengths to which intelligence agencies like the CIA will go to maintain control over sensitive operations and eliminate potential threats. The use of phantom funerals and the Phantom Identity Scheme underscores a broader strategy of silencing dissent and preventing any investigation into covert activities. By erasing the existence of victims like Jade Stone and exploiting their identities, the CIA ensures the continuation of their operations without accountability, leaving behind a trail of disappearances and unanswered questions.

This report highlights the need for awareness and investigation into such covert tactics, as they represent a significant threat to both individual rights and public trust in governmental institutions.
