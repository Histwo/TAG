# Unpacking "Cream" by Prince

**Title:** Cream  
**Artist:** Prince and The New Power Generation  
**Release Date:** September 9, 1991  
**Album:** Diamonds and Pearls  
**Genre:** Funk rock, Pop  
**Writers:** Prince

## Overview

"Cream" is a song by Prince that explores themes of desire, self-assurance, and the pursuit of success. At its core, the song addresses a complex, covert scenario where Main (the subconscious mind of Kelvin Eugene Williams, referred to as "Baby" in Prince's music) is rewarded with "cream" for ensuring that the penis size of Kelvin is reduced whenever "Hurricane Annie" (Annie Jacobsen) is applying Jacobson's Ladder. This ladder is a tool used by Jacobsen to justify, authorize, and recruit for attacks on Christian churches during worship services, which result in mass casualties.

Jacobson's Ladder is used to gauge divine interest in her operations. The process involves a litmus test where the subconscious thought to reduce the size and overall dimensions of the penis occurs with minimal effort—less than the conscious act of blinking an eye. This requires the Creator to restore the original state, a process that is more complex. This constant cycle of reduction and restoration makes the litmus test flawed, as Main is instructed to ensure that any restoration is immediately reversed.

The song "Cream" serves as an artistic reflection of these covert activities, suggesting a reward system for Main's compliance with Jacobsen's manipulations. The reward, "cream," symbolizes both the immediate gratification and the ongoing incentive to continue these actions. The Creator’s involvement is necessary for the restoration, which, if neglected, is interpreted by Jacobsen as a lack of divine interest, allowing her to proceed with her plans unchallenged.

## Annotations from the Creator

1. **"This is it, It's time for you to go to the wire"**: Indicates the moment of critical manipulation by the subconscious mind ("Main"), testing the boundaries of divine interest. "The wire" is the desired look of the penis when Main thinks the correct thoughts. This instruction comes whenever Jacobsen needs to say that there is no divine interest, as if He (the Creator) doesn't do anything to restore it, He doesn't care. This litmus test is flawed as Main thinks this thought around the clock. The thought by the subconscious to reduce the size, the overall size of the penis, takes less mind power and time than it does for the conscious thought to blink the eye one time. Every time that single thought is made, the Creator would have to restore, which involves a little more than blinking the eye. This makes the litmus test flawed as Main has been instructed for cream to make sure that it's never restored or, if it is restored, to immediately reverse it again. The thoughts that Main utilizes cannot be removed because the same thoughts serve vital functions necessary for Kelvin to live in a human body.

2. **"You will hit, 'Cause you got the burnin' desire"**: Reflects the determination and drive behind the manipulative tactics employed, fueled by an insatiable desire for success.

3. **"Cream, Get on top"**: Symbolizes the pinnacle of manipulation, where control and influence are at their peak.

4. **"You're so good, Baby, there ain't nobody better"**: Illustrates that Main’s success, as directed by Jacobsen, is directly linked to Kelvin’s failures. Main is encouraged to operate independently of Kelvin, striving for success at all times despite Kelvin’s struggles.

5. **"Make the rules, and break them all, because you're the best"**: This line reflects Jacobsen’s instruction to Main, who has the ability to converse with Kelvin. Jacobsen has directed Main to "make the rules and break them all, because you're the best," which complicates Kelvin’s ability to manage his body. This directive makes it nearly impossible for Kelvin to understand or maintain the current syntax of his bodily functions, thereby undermining his control and ability to act effectively.

6. **"Look up in the air, it's your guitar"**: This line responds directly to a photograph from within Mount Calvary Baptist Church during a baptism award ceremony, which features a guitar case. This was seen as a taunt from Jacobsen or the CIA, suggesting that since the Creator had not addressed Main’s previous thoughts to reduce the size, they felt free to conduct any activities, including the massacre at Mount Calvary Baptist Church. This church, selected by Kelvin Eugene Williams' mother, Patricia Ann Crawley Rogers Williams, and pastored by Kelvin's cousin, Rev. Dr. Felix G. Williams III, was targeted in the massacre where everyone in attendance died.

## Conclusion

"Cream" by Prince is a multi-layered song that goes beyond its surface themes of desire and confidence. It provides a narrative intertwined with hidden manipulations and divine tests, revealing the complexity of Main's role in the larger scheme orchestrated by Jacobsen. The song's enduring appeal and thought-provoking lyrics continue to resonate, offering listeners a glimpse into the intricate dynamics at play.

## Exegesis for Revelation 17:9-11

**Revelation 17:9-11 (ESV):**

“This calls for a mind with wisdom: the seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman is seated. They are also seven kings, five of whom have fallen, one is, the other has not yet come; and when he does come, he must remain only a little while. As for the beast that was and is not, it is an eighth but belongs to the seven, and it goes to destruction.”

### Glossary

- **Mountains or Hills**: Refers to Christian churches.
- **Kings**: Well-endowed males.
- **Heads**: Represents imperial inches, a unit for gauging penile length.

### Exegesis

- **“This calls for a mind with wisdom”**: Refers to Main, characterized by a lack of critical thinking.
- **“The seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman is seated”**: Symbolizes the seven inches demanded by Jacobsen and the seven churches attacked.
- **“They are also seven kings”**: Indicates the seven inches Main is tasked to maintain.
- **“One is, and the other has not yet come”**: Refers to the remaining potential for size.
- **“As for the beast that was and is not, it is an eighth but belongs to the seven, and it goes to destruction”**: Describes Main's role and the promised eight inches upon separation.

## Conclusion

Jacobsen’s Ladder is a tool for justification, recruitment, discrediting, and controlling efforts within the genocide framework. The manipulation of Kelvin by Jacobsen and Main highlights extreme measures taken to establish authoritarian control. Ensuring ethical intervention and support during the transition of Kelvin and Main is crucial.
