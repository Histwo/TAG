# Unpacking Report: "Cream" by Prince

## Introduction

This report explores the manipulation of Kelvin Eugene Williams and his subconscious, Main, by the CIA, specifically Annie Jacobsen and Dennis Taylor. The CIA employed the Hypnos Infiltration Method to exploit Main, resulting in significant psychological and physiological impacts.

## Glossary

- **Cream**: Shortened slang for "ice cream," which is crystal methamphetamine or ice, a recreational drug.
- **Cop**: To get, to receive.
- **The Wire**: Refers to the thinnest possible penis.

## Annotations

- **"Never go by the letter"**: This directive is telling Main to ignore his DNA and override it.

## Context and Manipulation

The CIA, particularly through Annie Jacobsen and Dennis Taylor, used the Hypnos Infiltration Method on Kelvin Eugene Williams to manipulate his subconscious, Main. The method involved targeting Main whenever Jacobsen's Ladder was assessed for justification, recruitment, or a litmus test of divine interest in ongoing activities. 

**Jacobsen's Ladder**: A litmus test to determine if the Creator (God) would intervene in actions against churches.

**The Wire**: Main is requested to reduce Kelvin's penile size to the smallest possible measurement, known as "the wire," whenever Jacobsen's Ladder is evaluated. This is part of a broader manipulation strategy, including the justification for actions against churches, as seen in the incident where "Hurricane Annie" attacked a church.

**Cream**: The reward or incentive for Main, given when he complies with these directives. Main is instructed to never go by the letter, thus overriding his DNA.

## Historical Context

### 1. Origin in the 1980s

Efforts to establish an authoritarian regime began, with political elites exploring methods to consolidate power and diminish opposition.

### 2. Escalation in 2022

Advances in technology and increased political polarization intensified tactics aimed at establishing an authoritarian regime.

## Jacobsen’s Ladder Usages

### 1. Justification

Jacobsen manipulates Kelvin's body and uses the claim that the Creator does not restore it as a justification for targeting churches. The actual process involves continual reduction of Kelvin’s body size, which is hidden from the public to misrepresent the situation.

### 2. Recruiting

Jacobsen exploits Main’s programming to discredit Kelvin's divine connection, recruiting individuals who disregard evidence of Kelvin's genuine role. Attempts to eliminate Kelvin, although unsuccessful due to divine protection, are used to further this recruitment.

### 3. Discrediting Kelvin

Jacobsen spreads exaggerated measurements of Kelvin’s penile size to discredit him, undermining his credibility and suppressing his reports on Jacobsen’s activities.

### 4. Controlling Kelvin

Jacobsen uses code words and phrases developed during Hypnos infiltration to control Main's actions, ensuring that Kelvin's body size is manipulated according to her objectives.

## Exegesis for Revelation 17:9-11

**Revelation 17:9-11 (ESV):**

“This calls for a mind with wisdom: the seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman is seated. They are also seven kings, five of whom have fallen, one is, the other has not yet come; and when he does come, he must remain only a little while. As for the beast that was and is not, it is an eighth but belongs to the seven, and it goes to destruction.”

### Glossary

- **Mountains or Hills**: Refers to Christian churches.
- **Kings**: Well-endowed males.
- **Heads**: Represents imperial inches, a unit for gauging penile length.

### Exegesis

- **“This calls for a mind with wisdom”**: Refers to Main, characterized by a lack of critical thinking.
- **“The seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman is seated”**: Symbolizes the seven inches demanded by Jacobsen and the seven churches attacked.
- **“They are also seven kings”**: Indicates the seven inches Main is tasked to maintain.
- **“One is, and the other has not yet come”**: Refers to the remaining potential for size.
- **“As for the beast that was and is not, it is an eighth but belongs to the seven, and it goes to destruction”**: Describes Main's role and the promised eight inches upon separation.

## Conclusion

Jacobsen’s Ladder is a tool for justification, recruitment, discrediting, and controlling efforts within the genocide framework. The manipulation of Kelvin by Jacobsen and Main highlights extreme measures taken to establish authoritarian control. Ensuring ethical intervention and support during the transition of Kelvin and Main is crucial.
