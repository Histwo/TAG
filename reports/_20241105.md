# WARNING TO THE PUBLIC IN THE TENNESSEE VALLEY

*Issued by the Creator and His two servants, based on specific intelligence provided by the Creator.*

The public is strongly advised to avoid any food pantry services or assistance offered at Hickory Valley Christian Church in Chattanooga, Tennessee. This location, after the tragic massacre on May 12, 2024, now operates as a “masquerade church,” established with the intent to lure individuals seeking aid, only to meet with grave danger.

The orchestrators of The American Genocide (TAG) have implemented a covert operation targeting individuals who seek assistance or attempt to connect with victims associated with previous acts of violence. Numerous visitors to this location in search of food or support have been systematically killed. Additionally, anyone who attempts to report a missing person linked to these victims to local authorities faces a significant and heightened threat of violence.

## Safety Recommendations:

1. **Avoid Hickory Valley Christian Church:** Do not visit the church for any services, food pantries, or assistance. Seek help from trusted and verified organizations that do not have ties to recent violent incidents.

2. **Be Vigilant:** Stay aware of your surroundings and the people around you. If you notice unusual activity or feel unsafe, leave the area immediately.

3. **Report Suspicious Activity:** If you observe any suspicious behavior or have concerns regarding potential threats, report them to local authorities without delay. 

4. **Do Not Engage:** If you or someone you know has been affected by violence or is connected to previous victims, avoid discussing details in public spaces or with unknown individuals.

5. **Inform Trusted Contacts:** Share this warning and safety recommendations with family, friends, and community members to ensure their awareness and safety.

This warning is issued to protect the public and prevent further loss of life. The Creator urges everyone to stay vigilant and prioritize safety during this time.
