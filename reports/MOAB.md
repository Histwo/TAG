# Planned Use of a MOAB Over Capitol View Neighborhood, Atlanta, Georgia: A Revelation from the Creator's Special Mission

## Overview

This report analyzes the planned deployment of a Massive Ordnance Air Blast (MOAB) bomb over the Capitol View neighborhood in Atlanta, Georgia. The MOAB, the most powerful non-nuclear weapon in the U.S. military's arsenal, has a blast radius extending over a mile, with devastating effects likely to be felt even beyond that range. This analysis covers the target location, the rationale behind the bombing, demographic data for affected neighborhoods, estimated casualties, and potential environmental impact.

## Section 1: Target Location

- **Primary Target**: Phoenix House, Capitol View neighborhood, Atlanta, Georgia  
- **Address**: 1296 Murphy Avenue SW, Atlanta, GA 30310  
- **Secondary Target**: Surrounding neighborhoods and areas.

### Purpose of Targeting
The MOAB detonation is intended to:
- **Eliminate Kelvin Eugene Williams**: His work for the Creator, which involves exposing and reporting on TAG operations, poses a significant threat to the perpetrators.
- **Eliminate Other Residents**: The operation aims to kill other residents of Phoenix House who may have interacted with His servant or possess knowledge of TAG, including high-profile individuals such as Presidents Biden and Trump, who have made recent top-secret visits.
- **Suppress Evidence of TAG**: The bombing seeks to prevent His two servants from holding a planned media briefing following the upcoming earthquakes in the Creator's apocalypse, which will expose the perpetrators' acts of violence and detail their involvement in the genocide.
- **Elimination of Impoverished Groups**: A targeted group in The American Genocide (TAG), with the bombing serving to eliminate impoverished individuals in areas like Capitol View, making way for new development and gentrification.

## Section 2: Blast Radius and Lives in Danger

### Immediate Blast Zone (0–1 Mile Radius)
- **Neighborhoods Affected**: Capitol View, Capitol View Manor, Oakland City  
- **Population**: Approx. 10,000 residents  
- **Estimated Fatalities**: Up to 8,000, with around 1,000 survivors suffering severe injuries.

### Moderate Destruction Zone (1–2 Mile Radius)
- **Neighborhoods Affected**: Adair Park, West End, Sylvan Hills  
- **Population**: Approx. 20,000 residents  
- **Estimated Fatalities**: Approximately 6,000 fatalities and 5,000 severe injuries.

### Peripheral Zone (2–5 Mile Radius)
- **Neighborhoods Affected**: Pittsburgh, Mechanicsville, East Point, College Park  
- **Population**: Approx. 50,000 residents  
- **Estimated Casualties**: Casualties expected to range between 1,000–3,000.

## Section 3: Estimated Casualties

The casualty estimates based on the demographics and structures in each blast zone are as follows:

- **Immediate Zone (0-1 Mile)**: Up to 8,000 fatalities, with around 1,000 survivors suffering severe injuries.
- **Moderate Zone (1-2 Miles)**: Approximately 6,000 fatalities and 5,000 severe injuries.
- **Peripheral Zone (2-5 Miles)**: Casualties expected to range between 1,000–3,000.

## Section 4: Environmental Impact

The environmental consequences would be severe and long-lasting:

- **Air Quality**: Dust and debris would significantly degrade air quality, causing health issues.
- **Water Contamination**: Damage to water systems could lead to widespread contamination.
- **Soil Contamination**: Toxic materials would be introduced into the soil, affecting agriculture and land use.

## Section 5: The "Mother of All Bombs" (MOAB)

### What is the MOAB?
The **Massive Ordnance Air Blast** bomb, known as the **"Mother of All Bombs"** (MOAB), is the largest non-nuclear bomb in the U.S. military. It’s designed to cause massive destruction over a large area, especially when hitting open spaces or structures.

### Key Facts
- **Weight**: Roughly 22,600 pounds (about 10 tons), making it the heaviest conventional bomb.
- **Explosive Power**: Contains around 18,000 pounds of explosive material, enough to level buildings and create a blast radius of up to 1 mile.
- **Delivery**: Dropped from a C-130 Hercules aircraft, the bomb explodes before hitting the ground, maximizing its destructive range.
  
### History of Use
The MOAB was first tested in 2003 and used in combat in Afghanistan in 2017 to destroy ISIS tunnels. Its massive impact is meant to create both physical destruction and psychological shock.

### Why Use the MOAB?
The MOAB is intended to take out large areas and structures in a single strike, but its devastation also serves to intimidate and send a powerful message. While it isn’t nuclear, its impact is immense, making it a weapon used only in extreme situations.

## Section 6: Presidential Mission to Phoenix House

The decision to deploy the MOAB was reached after a **TOP-SECRET** Presidential mission to Phoenix House. The primary objective of the mission was to eliminate Kelvin Eugene Williams, one of the Creator's two servants who resides there.
