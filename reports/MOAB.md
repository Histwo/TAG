# Report on the Planned MOAB Detonation in Southwest Atlanta

## Introduction

A devastating event is set to occur in southwest Atlanta between 1:00 AM and 5:00 AM. The detonation of a GBU-43/B Massive Ordnance Air Blast (MOAB), widely known as the “Mother of All Bombs,” will immediately follow seismic activity initiated by the Creator as part of His divine intervention. These earthquakes serve as a wake-up call, drawing attention to an ongoing hidden atrocity referred to as The American Genocide (TAG). The Creator’s servants are scheduled to hold a media briefing immediately after the earthquakes to raise awareness and bring an end to these atrocities.

This report, compiled by the Creator’s two servants, provides comprehensive details about the planned detonation, its catastrophic consequences, and the broader motives behind this action. The information is derived from the Creator’s direct intervention and observations of events surrounding The American Genocide.

## Who is the Creator?

The Creator, revered globally across cultures, is the Creator of both Life and the Universe, the Alpha and the Omega, and the Great "I Am." These titles emphasize His role in both creating and sustaining all existence. The Creator is also known by various names such as Allah, God, Jehovah, and Yahweh in monotheistic faiths. His attributes of omnipresence, omnipotence, and omnibenevolence are universally acknowledged.

The Creator’s two servants neutrally refer to Him as the Creator, in accordance with His directive to respect diverse religious beliefs. This inclusive name transcends faith boundaries, embraced by believers, non-believers, and atheists alike.

The Creator was and is Jesus Christ, and His direct intervention in these events marks His second coming. His actions aim to combat the injustices of The American Genocide and save lives.

## The American Genocide (TAG)

### Summary of The American Genocide (TAG)

The American Genocide (TAG) refers to a hidden and systematic effort to eliminate vulnerable populations, primarily targeting impoverished and marginalized communities across the United States. This ongoing atrocity operates covertly, utilizing extreme methods to inflict mass casualties while concealing evidence of its execution.

**Key elements of TAG include:**

- **The Seven Church Massacres (in Revelation, “Plagues” or “Death”)**: A series of surprise assaults on Christian churches during their weekly worship sessions, initially targeting minority congregations in Kentucky, but expanding to include white congregations in Kentucky and Chattanooga, Tennessee, resulting in thousands of fatalities. These massacres left no survivors and were followed by the targeted assassinations of any identified church member not present and those who shared a dwelling with a church member. With their respective congregations missing, the orchestrators utilized church properties for phantom funerals, phantom pantries, and other mock services intended to eliminate any associates of the congregation and the broader general public—without regard to their religious preferences or adherence.

- **Phantom Funerals (in Revelation, “Mourning”)**: Refers to a mass execution disguised as a funeral, a covert tactic used in the context of The American Genocide (TAG) operations. These funerals, orchestrated by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), serve as Continued Acts of Violence (CAVs) following a church massacre. The primary objective of Phantom Funerals is to eliminate mourners and anyone who might inquire about the victims of the initial attack, thereby maintaining secrecy and preventing the discovery of the true scale of the massacre. Phantom Funerals are a calculated extension of the violence initiated during TAG.

- **Phantom Pantries (in Revelation, “Famine”)**: During The American Genocide (TAG), food pantries hosted by masquerade churches (after a church massacre and on the property of a church that suffered the assault) were strategically weaponized to inflict harm on vulnerable populations under the guise of humanitarian aid. Phantom Pantries were set up exclusively to conduct mass executions. No individual who sought assistance from these pantries left alive. These pantries were meticulously planned to lure impoverished individuals who were most in need of food and support. Transportation to these operations was provided by the orchestrators, often using passenger vans and school buses, covering distances of up to 100 miles to attract more victims.

TAG remains largely undetected due to its orchestrators' efforts to suppress evidence and silence dissent. Through the Creator’s intervention and revelations, the truth is being exposed to bring an end to this ongoing atrocity.

## Planned Impacts of the Detonation

### Immediate Devastation

The detonation will wreak havoc across southwest Atlanta, targeting impoverished and marginalized communities. Key impacts include:

- **Fatalities and Injuries**: At least 7,000 lives will be lost, with thousands more suffering severe injuries. The casualty rates are predicted to range from 50–70% within the immediate blast zone.

- **Blast Radius Impacts**:

  - **Immediate Zone (1 Mile)**: Neighborhoods like West End, Ashview Heights, and Oakland City will face near-total destruction.
  - **Secondary Zone (1–3 Miles)**: Areas such as Vine City, Castleberry Hill, and Mechanicsville will experience significant damage, with casualty rates of 20–40%.
  - **Tertiary Zone (3–5 Miles)**: Downtown Atlanta, Midtown, and Grant Park will see structural damage and debris injuries, with casualties ranging from 5–15%.

### Rescue Challenges Due to Darkness and Power Outages

The timing of the detonation between 1:00 AM and 5:00 AM is strategically chosen to maximize harm:

- **Power Grid Failure**: The explosion will disable power infrastructure, plunging rescue operations into darkness. Emergency responders will face delays in locating and assisting victims.
- **Visibility Issues**: Rescue teams will struggle to navigate debris-laden streets without adequate lighting, increasing casualties due to delayed medical attention.
- **Resource Strain**: Emergency response units, already limited in number, will be overwhelmed, exacerbating the loss of life and prolonging survivors’ exposure to life-threatening conditions.

### Overwhelmed Medical Facilities

Atlanta’s healthcare system is unprepared for the scale of this disaster:

- **Limited Emergency Room Beds**: Atlanta has approximately 2,500 emergency room beds, a fraction of what is needed for an estimated 10,000+ injured. Many victims will go untreated or face critical delays in care, significantly increasing the fatality rate.
- **Infant Vulnerability**: Many young children, potentially losing their parents in the chaos, will face neglect in rescue efforts. The lack of specialized pediatric care and disorganization during rescue operations may lead to preventable infant fatalities.

### Long-Term Implications

The repercussions of the detonation will extend far beyond the immediate aftermath:

- **Psychological Trauma**: Survivors, including children, will face long-term mental health challenges such as PTSD, depression, and anxiety, with limited access to counseling services in the affected areas.
- **Homelessness and Poverty**: The destruction of homes and businesses will displace tens of thousands, forcing families into shelters during winter. With insufficient resources, many will struggle to rebuild their lives.
- **Economic Inequality**: Impoverished communities will bear the brunt of the destruction, further entrenching cycles of poverty. The orchestrators will exploit this opportunity for financial gain through redevelopment initiatives.

### Financial and Gentrification Motives

The MOAB detonation aligns with the financial interests of its orchestrators:

- **Displacement for Profit**: The destruction of low-income neighborhoods will facilitate gentrification. Wealthy developers, many of whom are connected to those orchestrating the detonation, will seize land at reduced costs, transforming it into high-end residential and commercial properties.
- **Increased Property Values**: Redeveloped areas will cater to affluent populations, driving up property values and rents, effectively pricing out surviving residents.
- **Political Leverage**: The orchestrators will manipulate disaster recovery efforts to secure contracts, funneling resources to their own companies and allies under the guise of aid.

## Why Would the Creator Allow This to Happen?

According to the Creator, the entire Book of Revelation reveals the hidden genocide occurring in the United States, a devastating atrocity that, if left unchecked, would surpass the death toll of the Holocaust. The efforts of the United States federal government to suppress and conceal information about these crimes have allowed them to continue unchecked. Without divine intervention, the full scale of this genocide would remain hidden, and its orchestrators would continue their reign of terror with no accountability.

The Creator, in His infinite wisdom, decided long ago that His direct intervention would be necessary to halt the ongoing atrocities. In His divine plan, He sent His two servants to operate undercover, gathering the critical information needed to expose and dismantle the operations of those responsible for The American Genocide (TAG). These orchestrators are seven powerful individuals—figures who, to most Americans, appear untouchable by conventional justice. Yet, the Creator knows the depths of their actions and has empowered His servants to expose the truth and hold them accountable.

The Creator’s love for His creation is unwavering and unconditional. He assures those who seek Him that His love will never leave them. For those who have been martyred in this genocide, He has not forsaken them. Their deaths, though tragic, were necessary sacrifices to fulfill the Creator's plan and bring an end to this atrocity. Their martyrdom will ultimately contribute to the exposure of the genocide and bring justice to the oppressed.

The Creator will use His two servants as instruments of divine justice. Their sacred mission will be to expose the orchestrators of TAG, which include Presidents Biden and President-Elect Trump, and ensure their lifelong confinement. This confinement will last throughout the Age of Aquarius, a period that spans approximately 2,500 years. The Age of Aquarius began on October 17, 2024, and during this time, the Creator’s servants will continue their work with unwavering devotion, fulfilling their purpose in alignment with His divine will. The orchestrators of TAG, despite their power, will not evade divine justice. Their confinement will be a reflection of the severity of their crimes and will ensure that they can no longer harm the innocent.

During this age, the Creator’s servants will tirelessly work to ensure the orchestrators of this genocide face the justice they deserve. Their mission is not only to expose the truth but to ensure the perpetrators are held accountable for their actions, ensuring that no future generations will be subject to the same horrors.

## Call to Action

Residents within the projected blast zones must prepare immediately:

- **Evacuation Readiness**: Stay alert for seismic activity, which will precede the detonation. Prepare emergency supplies, including food, water, and clothing, and establish evacuation routes.
- **Community Awareness**: Share this information widely to ensure others are prepared. Early action can save lives.
- **Pray**: While the Creator does not endorse any religion or require worship, He does answer prayer and encourages anyone who finds this report (or associated advisories) difficult to believe to say a quick prayer asking Him for guidance.

## Conclusion

The planned MOAB detonation in southwest Atlanta is a catastrophic escalation in a broader campaign to suppress the truth about The American Genocide. Its orchestrators aim to silence dissent, erase evidence, and profit from tragedy. The Creator’s revelations, shared through His servants, offer a unique opportunity to prevent further suffering and hold those responsible accountable.

This report is a call for vigilance, action, and unity in the face of impending disaster. Together, we can challenge oppression and work toward justice and truth.
