# Wag the Dog: The Planned MOAB Detonation and The American Genocide

---

### **Executive Summary**

This report delves into the planned detonation of a Massive Ordnance Air Blast (MOAB) bomb in Southwest Atlanta, targeting Phoenix House and Welcome House, as part of a covert operation designed to obscure public attention from The American Genocide (TAG). TAG is a systemic and covert genocide orchestrated by the CIA and U.S. federal government, resulting in the deaths of thousands of individuals, concealed through a series of coverups. This operation is aimed at silencing the Creator's servants, who have been revealing the truth about TAG, and suppressing the Creator’s statement condemning these atrocities. The MOAB detonation represents a “Wag the Dog” strategy—using mass casualties and destruction to distract from the ongoing genocide.

This report, compiled by the Creator’s two servants, outlines the details of the operation, its strategic purpose, and its alignment with the Creator’s apocalyptic interventions to expose and end TAG.

### **Introduction**

#### **Definition of a "Wag the Dog" Operation**

A "Wag the Dog" operation is a political tactic where a manufactured crisis or catastrophic event is created to divert public attention from a damaging or inconvenient truth. Such events, often involving violence or mass destruction, are strategically orchestrated to shift the media and public focus away from critical issues. Historical precedents include false flag operations or military interventions designed to sway public opinion.

#### **The MOAB Operation in Context**

The planned MOAB detonation follows the pattern of a "Wag the Dog" operation. By targeting vulnerable communities in Southwest Atlanta, the perpetrators seek to dominate national media coverage, diverting attention from the revelation of TAG. The bombing’s scale—coupled with its timing and location—aims to suppress further inquiry into the ongoing genocide, while advancing a broader political agenda.

#### **Background on The American Genocide (TAG)**

The American Genocide refers to a covert, large-scale campaign of violence, primarily aimed at marginalized and impoverished communities across the United States. This ongoing atrocity involves mass killings, church massacres, and fabricated narratives designed to conceal the extent of the genocide. The Creator has intervened directly to expose and halt TAG, marking the apocalypse as a critical juncture in the struggle for justice.

### **Operation Details**

#### **Target Locations**

- **Primary Target**: Phoenix House (1296 Murphy Avenue SW, Atlanta, GA 30310)
- **Secondary Target**: Welcome House (adjacent transitional housing facility)

Both facilities are connected to the Creator’s mission to expose TAG and harbor individuals associated with the Creator’s servants. Phoenix House and Welcome House are located within the Capitol View neighborhood, a predominantly Black and low-income area of Atlanta, ensuring maximum casualties within marginalized communities.

#### **Strategic Purpose**

1. **Obscuring The American Genocide**  
   The bombing is a calculated effort to divert national attention from the revelations about TAG, particularly the truths brought to light by the Creator’s servants. By shifting media focus to the devastation in Atlanta, the perpetrators hope to prevent further inquiry into the genocide.

2. **Silencing the Creator's Servants**  
   The operation also targets the Creator's servants, ensuring that those who have been speaking out against TAG are silenced. Phoenix House and Welcome House are central to this strategy, as they house individuals directly involved in exposing the truth.

3. **Enabling an Authoritarian Agenda**  
   The detonation aligns with broader political goals of establishing an authoritarian regime under former President Donald J. Trump. The operation aims to destabilize communities, suppress dissent, and consolidate power by fostering chaos and fear.

### **Estimated Impact**

#### **Casualties**

- **Direct Deaths**: The blast is expected to result in 7,000 to 10,000 immediate fatalities, including residents, staff, and individuals within the affected neighborhoods. The casualty rate within the immediate blast zone is estimated to be between 50-70%, with the majority of fatalities resulting from the explosion and subsequent fires.
  
- **Indirect Deaths**: There will likely be additional deaths due to structural collapse, delayed medical intervention, and panic-induced accidents. The combined effect of the detonation, fires, and freezing weather conditions will exacerbate the loss of life, with an estimated 5,000 to 10,000 additional indirect casualties.

#### **Economic Consequences**

- **Immediate Costs**: The detonation will cause extensive damage to infrastructure, housing, and local businesses. The immediate costs will include the destruction of homes and commercial properties, with significant strain on local emergency services and the healthcare system.
  
- **Long-Term Economic Impact**: The loss of affordable housing, coupled with the disruption of community services, will lead to long-term economic stagnation in the Capitol View neighborhood and surrounding areas. Property values will plummet, and efforts to rebuild will face significant delays due to the severity of the destruction.

#### **Social and Political Repercussions**

- **Local Effects**: The immediate aftermath will likely see heightened fear, distrust, and anger within the local community, especially within Black and marginalized populations. Widespread trauma will lead to a breakdown in social cohesion.
  
- **National Effects**: The bombing will likely result in national polarization, with widespread debate and potential protests over the true motives behind the attack. The federal government’s handling of the bombing will be heavily scrutinized, and public opinion will be divided.

### **Connection to the Apocalypse**

#### **The Creator's Statement**

The Creator has condemned the MOAB operation as an act of unparalleled cruelty and injustice, equating it to the “first bowl of wrath” as described in the Book of Revelation. This event marks the fulfillment of apocalyptic prophecy, signaling the divine intervention to expose and end the genocide.

#### **Prophetic Fulfillment**

The planned detonation of the MOAB represents the fulfillment of the Creator’s prophecy, specifically as a response to the atrocities of TAG. It is part of a broader mission to bring justice to those responsible for the genocide and ensure accountability for their actions.

#### **Divine Justice**

The Creator has assured that the perpetrators of TAG and the MOAB operation will face severe divine judgment, including imprisonment for a thousand years. Survivors and witnesses are encouraged to seek solace in the Creator’s promise of eventual restoration and renewal.

### **Conclusion**

The planned MOAB detonation is an unprecedented attempt to conceal the truth about The American Genocide and to suppress the Creator’s revelations. However, the Creator’s intervention ensures that justice will prevail. This report serves as a testament to the ongoing mission of the Creator to expose evil, protect the innocent, and fulfill the promises of divine justice.

#### **Call to Action**

Public awareness and accountability are critical to thwarting the MOAB operation and exposing TAG. Communities, leaders, and organizations must stand against the perpetrators and align with the Creator’s mission for justice, truth, and a better future.
