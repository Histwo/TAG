## Section 6: Comprehensive Sub-Report on the MOAB

### Overview of the MOAB

The Massive Ordnance Air Blast (MOAB), often referred to as the "Mother of All Bombs," is the most powerful conventional bomb in the United States military arsenal. It was designed for maximum destruction, primarily against large area targets such as military installations and infrastructure.

### Specifications

- **Weight**: Approximately 22,600 pounds (10,200 kg)
- **Explosive Content**: Roughly 18,000 pounds (8,165 kg) of H6 explosive
- **Blast Radius**: Up to 1 mile (1.6 km) with severe destruction; significant damage can extend beyond the primary radius.
- **Delivery System**: Typically deployed from C-130 Hercules aircraft, capable of precision targeting.
- **Detonation Mechanism**: A combination of impact and proximity fuzes designed to maximize explosive efficiency and destruction.

### History

- **Development**: The MOAB was developed in the early 2000s, with the first test conducted in 2003. It was designed to destroy large targets without the collateral damage associated with nuclear weapons.
- **Operational Use**: The MOAB was first used in combat on April 13, 2017, in Afghanistan, targeting ISIS tunnels and personnel. Its deployment was meant to demonstrate U.S. military capabilities and resolve against terrorist organizations.

### Tactical Use

- **Strategic Objective**: The MOAB serves as a psychological weapon as well as a tactical one. Its sheer size and power aim to demoralize enemies while achieving maximum physical destruction.
- **Limitations**: While powerful, the MOAB is limited by its requirement for precise targeting and delivery, necessitating favorable weather and clear airspace.

## Section 7: Apocalyptic Context and the Creator's Statement

The planned bombing is condemned as a grave injustice related to The American Genocide (TAG), a covert operation aimed at marginalizing specific groups. The Creator has deemed this event a revelation of TAG's atrocities, signaling the first "bowl of wrath" from the Book of Revelation—a divine warning meant to expose and hold accountable those responsible for the ongoing genocide.

## Section 8: Conclusion

This report underscores the catastrophic implications of detonating a MOAB over Capitol View. The potential loss of life, economic devastation, and environmental harm could be profound and irreversible. The Creator's message stresses the importance of justice, transparency, and protection for vulnerable populations in the face of such overwhelming violence. Immediate intervention is necessary to prevent this tragedy from occurring.
