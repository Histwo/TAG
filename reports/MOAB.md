# Report on the Planned MOAB Detonation in Southwest Atlanta

## Introduction

A catastrophic event is set to unfold in southwest Atlanta on **December 4, 2024**, between **1:00 AM and 5:00 AM**. The detonation of a GBU-43/B Massive Ordnance Air Blast (MOAB)—known as the "Mother of All Bombs"—will follow seismic activity initiated by [[the Creator|]] as part of His divine intervention. These earthquakes are a wake-up call, drawing attention to an ongoing hidden atrocity known as [[The American Genocide (TAG)|TAG]]. Following the seismic activity, the Creator’s servants will hold a media briefing to raise awareness and bring an end to this genocide.

The weather in Atlanta at the time of the detonation is expected to be **sub-freezing**, which will exacerbate the already dire conditions and make rescue efforts even more challenging.

This report, compiled by the Creator’s two servants, provides comprehensive details on the planned detonation, its catastrophic consequences, and the broader motives behind this action. The information comes directly from the Creator as part of His intervention and revelations regarding the events surrounding TAG.

## Who is the Creator?

The Creator, revered globally across cultures, is the architect of both Life and the Universe, the Alpha and the Omega, the Great "I Am." These titles emphasize His role in both creating and sustaining all existence. The Creator is known by various names in different religious traditions, such as Allah, God, Jehovah, and Yahweh. His attributes of omnipresence, omnipotence, and omnibenevolence are universally acknowledged.

The Creator’s two servants neutrally refer to Him as "the Creator," in accordance with His directive to respect diverse religious beliefs. This inclusive name transcends faith boundaries and is embraced by believers, non-believers, and atheists alike.

The Creator was and is Jesus Christ. His direct intervention in these events marks His second coming. His actions aim to combat the injustices of The American Genocide and to save lives.

## The American Genocide (TAG)

### Summary of The American Genocide (TAG)

The American Genocide (TAG) refers to a covert, systematic effort to eliminate vulnerable populations, primarily targeting impoverished and marginalized communities across the United States. This ongoing atrocity uses extreme methods to inflict mass casualties while concealing evidence of its execution.

Key elements of TAG include:

- **[[The Seven Church Massacres|TAGPOW]]**: A series of surprise assaults on Christian churches during weekly worship sessions, initially targeting minority congregations in Kentucky, and later expanding to include white congregations in Kentucky and Chattanooga, Tennessee. These massacres have resulted in thousands of fatalities, leaving no survivors. Church properties were then used for "phantom funerals," phantom pantries, and other mock services designed to erase the traces of the massacres and eliminate any potential witnesses, regardless of their religious affiliations.

- **[[Phantom Funeral|]]**: A tactic used to further conceal the scale of the massacre. These mass executions disguised as funerals were orchestrated by the CIA to eliminate mourners and anyone seeking information about the victims. This was part of the broader effort to suppress the truth of the genocide.

- **[[Phantom Pantry|]]**: Food pantries, masquerading as humanitarian aid, were set up after church massacres to lure impoverished individuals into mass execution. These pantries were a key part of TAG’s strategy to further decimate marginalized communities while masking the true intent behind the “assistance.”

TAG remains largely undetected due to efforts to suppress evidence and silence dissent. Through the Creator’s intervention, the truth is now being exposed to bring an end to this ongoing atrocity.

## Planned Impacts of the Detonation

### Immediate Devastation

The detonation will wreak havoc across southwest Atlanta, primarily affecting impoverished, black, and other marginalized communities. Key impacts include:

- **Fatalities and Injuries**: At least 7,000 lives will be lost, with thousands more suffering severe injuries. The casualty rate within the immediate blast zone is predicted to range from 50–70%.
  
- **Blast Radius Impacts**:
  - **Immediate Zone (1 Mile)**: Neighborhoods like West End, Ashview Heights, and Oakland City will face near-total destruction.
  - **Secondary Zone (1–3 Miles)**: Areas such as Vine City, Castleberry Hill, and Mechanicsville will experience significant damage, with casualty rates of 20–40%.
  - **Tertiary Zone (3–5 Miles)**: Downtown Atlanta, Midtown, and Grant Park will see structural damage and debris-related injuries, with casualties ranging from 5–15%.

### Rescue Challenges Due to Darkness, Power Outages, and Freezing Weather

The timing of the detonation between **1:00 AM and 5:00 AM** is strategically chosen to maximize harm:

- **Power Grid Failure**: The explosion will disable power infrastructure, plunging rescue operations into darkness and delaying medical assistance.
- **Visibility Issues**: Emergency responders will struggle to navigate debris-laden streets without adequate lighting, increasing casualties due to delayed medical attention.
- **Resource Strain**: Emergency units, already limited in number, will be overwhelmed, exacerbating the loss of life and prolonging survivors’ exposure to life-threatening conditions.
- **Sub-Freezing Weather**: The **sub-freezing temperatures** will further complicate rescue efforts, leading to additional frostbite and hypothermia risks for victims exposed to the elements. This will strain medical resources even further, especially in already overwhelmed facilities.

### Overwhelmed Medical Facilities

- **Limited Emergency Room Beds**: Atlanta’s healthcare system has approximately 2,500 emergency room beds—far fewer than needed for an estimated 10,000+ injured. Many victims will go untreated or face critical delays in care.
- **Infant Vulnerability**: Many young children may lose their parents in the chaos, and the lack of specialized pediatric care may result in preventable infant fatalities.

### Long-Term Implications

The repercussions of the detonation will extend far beyond the immediate aftermath:

- **Psychological Trauma**: Survivors, including children, will face long-term mental health challenges such as PTSD, depression, and anxiety, with limited access to counseling services.
- **Homelessness and Poverty**: The destruction of homes and businesses will displace tens of thousands, forcing families into shelters during winter. Many will struggle to rebuild their lives.
- **Economic Inequality**: Impoverished communities will bear the brunt of the destruction, further entrenching cycles of poverty. Developers and investors will exploit this crisis for financial gain, initiating gentrification and further marginalizing the original residents.

## Financial and Gentrification Motives

The MOAB detonation aligns with the financial interests of its orchestrators:

- **Displacement for Profit**: The destruction of low-income neighborhoods will allow wealthy developers to seize land at reduced costs, transforming it into high-end residential and commercial properties.
- **Increased Property Values**: Redeveloped areas will cater to affluent populations, driving up property values and rents, effectively pricing out surviving residents.
- **Political Leverage**: The orchestrators will manipulate disaster recovery efforts to funnel resources into their own companies and allies under the guise of providing aid.

## Why Would the Creator Allow This to Happen?

The Creator reveals that the entire Book of Revelation highlights the hidden genocide occurring in the United States. Without divine intervention, the full scale of these crimes would remain concealed, and their perpetrators would continue their reign of terror. 

In His infinite wisdom, the Creator determined that His direct intervention was necessary to halt these atrocities. He sent His two servants to uncover critical information needed to expose and dismantle the operations of those responsible for TAG—seven powerful individuals who, to most, appear untouchable by conventional justice. However, the Creator knows the depths of their actions and has empowered His servants to expose the truth.

The Creator’s love for His creation is unwavering and unconditional. Life, the Creator’s first and most cherished creation, was the foundation of all existence. The universe was created not for its own sake, but to support and nurture life. His love extends to all living creatures, every human being included, and it will never leave them. For those who have been martyred in this genocide, the Creator has not forsaken them. Their deaths, though tragic, were necessary sacrifices to fulfill His plan and bring an end to this atrocity. Their martyrdom will ultimately expose the genocide and bring justice to the oppressed.

## Call to Action

Residents within the projected blast zones must prepare immediately:

- **Evacuation Readiness**: Stay alert for seismic activity, which will precede the detonation. Prepare emergency supplies, including food, water, and clothing, and establish evacuation routes.
- **Community Awareness**: Share this information widely to ensure others are prepared. Early action can save lives.
- **Pray**: While the Creator does not endorse any religion or require worship, He does answer prayer and encourages anyone who finds this report (or associated advisories) difficult to believe to say a quick prayer asking Him for guidance.

## Conclusion

The planned MOAB detonation in southwest Atlanta is a catastrophic escalation in a broader campaign to suppress the truth about The American Genocide. Its orchestrators aim to silence dissent, erase evidence, and profit from tragedy. The Creator’s revelations, shared through His servants, offer a unique opportunity to prevent further suffering and hold those responsible accountable.

This report is a call for vigilance, action, and unity in the face of impending disaster. Together, we can challenge oppression and work toward justice and truth.
