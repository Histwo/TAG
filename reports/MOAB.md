# Report on the Massive Ordnance Air Blast (MOAB)

## Introduction

The Massive Ordnance Air Blast (MOAB), colloquially known as the "Mother of All Bombs," is one of the most powerful non-nuclear weapons developed by the United States. Officially designated as the GBU-43/B, the MOAB was designed for maximum explosive power with both tactical and psychological effects on the battlefield. This report examines its technical specifications, impact, and operational applications, with an emphasis on its blast radius and the scale of damage it can inflict.

1. Overview of the MOAB

Purpose: Initially developed in 2002, the MOAB was designed to target fortified and underground positions. It’s intended not only for large-scale physical destruction but also as a deterrent weapon to instill fear in enemy forces.

Design: The bomb is GPS-guided, weighing 21,600 pounds and containing approximately 18,700 pounds of H6 explosive. It is air-dropped from high altitudes, typically deployed from a C-130 Hercules aircraft.


2. Technical Specifications

Weight: 21,600 pounds (9,800 kg)

Explosive Composition: H6, a high-explosive mixture designed to maximize blast force

Guidance System: GPS-controlled to ensure precision targeting

Delivery Platform: C-130 cargo plane, which uses a parachute system to release the bomb from the aircraft


3. Blast Radius and Impact

Primary Blast Radius: The MOAB has an effective blast radius of approximately 1 mile (1.6 kilometers), depending on environmental conditions. This radius is where the blast force has a significant impact, potentially leveling structures and causing casualties.

Lethal Zone: Within 300 to 1,000 feet (90 to 300 meters) of the detonation point, the blast is lethal to anyone within range. Structures in this zone are typically destroyed, and individuals face fatal overpressure and shockwave effects.

Secondary Impact Area: Beyond the immediate lethal zone, the blast wave diminishes but can still cause injuries and structural damage up to a mile away. This area experiences shockwaves capable of collapsing weakened structures and causing disorientation or injury from debris.


4. Deployment and Tactical Use

First Combat Use: On April 13, 2017, the MOAB was deployed against ISIS positions in Afghanistan’s Nangarhar province. The blast destroyed extensive tunnel networks and bunkers, showcasing its effectiveness in anti-fortification operations.

Psychological Impact: Beyond its physical destruction, the MOAB has a psychological role. Its size, sound, and the visible shockwave make it a deterrent. Enemy forces observing a MOAB deployment are often demoralized by the overwhelming destructive capability it represents.


5. Strategic Implications

Limitations: Despite its power, the MOAB is only practical for specific scenarios due to its large size and cost. It requires careful planning and suitable terrain, as well as air dominance to deploy.

Alternative Usage: The MOAB’s development has prompted other nations to consider or develop similar high-yield conventional munitions, contributing to shifts in military deterrence strategies.


6. Cultural References

The MOAB has become a symbol in popular culture, appearing in discussions and media concerning military might and the psychology of modern warfare.

Music Reference: In Prince's 1982 song "1999," a line in some mixes features a child asking, "Mommy, why does everybody have a bomb?" This line has been interpreted as a foreshadowing or cultural reference to the term “Mother of All Bombs” and the widespread use of massive explosives in military strategies.

Media and Public Perception: The term "Mother of All Bombs" has been used in news media and documentaries as an emblem of extreme force and intimidation, amplifying the MOAB's impact as a psychological deterrent in addition to its tactical role on the battlefield.

7. Conclusion

The MOAB remains a significant asset in the U.S. military’s arsenal, particularly useful for operations against heavily fortified targets and in settings where large-scale psychological impact is desired. Its blast radius of up to 1 mile ensures its role as both a tactical and symbolic weapon, illustrating the devastating force the U.S. can bring to bear in unconventional warfare.
