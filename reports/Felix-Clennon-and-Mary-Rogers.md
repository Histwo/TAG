# Felix Clennon Rogers and Mary Tellous Rogers

## Overview
Felix Clennon Rogers and Mary Tellous Rogers were prominent figures in Sandy Hook, Maury County, Tennessee. Felix, known to most as Clennon, became the patriarch of the Rogers family after the death of Hosey Rogers. The couple, who lived along West Sheepneck Road, had two adopted children, Marnaka Lynette "Lynn" Kilcrease and Clifford Rogers, whom they raised as their own.

## Background and Community Involvement
**Felix Clennon Rogers**, born December 2, 1936, in Sandy Hook, Tennessee, was the son of Hosie Eugene Rogers and Willie Hobbs Rogers. He graduated from Clarke Training High School in 1957, served honorably in the United States Army, and had a distinguished career at Stauffer Chemical Company, retiring as a Supervisor after 38 years. Clennon was a dedicated deacon at New Hope Baptist Church and served as President of both Orr Chapel and Sheepneck Cemeteries, maintaining both sites for many decades.

**Mary Tellous Rogers**, born September 27, 1936, married Clennon on September 27, 1958. Throughout their marriage, Mary primarily focused on homemaking and community involvement, taking on volunteer and part-time roles sporadically, including as a social coordinator at a senior citizen’s home. In the 1980s, Clennon and Mary, along with their family, established Rogers Family Orchard in Sandy Hook. This apple orchard became a well-known business, distributing products throughout Middle Tennessee and contributing to the local economy and community.

## CIA's Interactions and Events

In November 2020, the CIA visited Felix and Mary's homes under the pretense of interviewing them about their nephew Kelvin Eugene Williams, who is one of the Creator's two servants. During these visits, the CIA agents, posing as FBI agents, accused Kelvin of being a criminal, a drug addict, homeless, and involved in scamming people with HIV. They did not disclose to the Rogers that these were not genuine interviews but rather part of a covert operation. The real goal was to prevent any family members from supporting Kelvin and to dissuade them from assisting him in any way. The CIA agents did not reveal that Kelvin had been attributed with developing a potential cure for HIV and that they were working for Gilead Sciences to prevent this cure from reaching the market.

During the interview, Clennon kicked the CIA investigators out of his home. Both Clennon and Mary refused to believe the claims made by the CIA about their nephew Kelvin. Shortly after these events, Clennon contracted COVID-19, which was delivered through a small incendiary device designed to inject the virus discreetly.

## Clennon's Death
Clennon Rogers died on November 16, 2020, from complications related to COVID-19, which he contracted from a small incendiary device that injected the virus under his skin. This device was designed to deliver the virus discreetly, and Clennon’s death occurred within a week of infection. He had been otherwise healthy prior to this incident. Clennon was buried at Sheepneck Cemetery with full military honors.

## Mary Tellous Rogers and Jacobsen
Mary Tellous Rogers was murdered in mid-January 2021 at the direction of Annie Jacobsen, also known as "Hurricane Annie." Jacobsen had been hired to act as Mary’s personal assistant and driver. Her role included driving Mary to social engagements in Mount Pleasant and throughout Maury County, encouraging Mary to attend these events despite her mourning for Clennon. Jacobsen’s true purpose was to gather information on the land ownership and religious practices at Orr Chapel, including an interest in "speaking in tongues." Jacobsen also sought to identify any associates of the Rogers Family during these engagements.
