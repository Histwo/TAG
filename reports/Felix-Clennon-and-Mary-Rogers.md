**Felix CLENNON and Mary Tellous Rogers**

**Introduction**

This report outlines the lives of Felix Clennon Rogers and Mary Tellous Rogers, their connections to Sandy Hook, Tennessee, and the broader implications of their family circumstances. It also examines Patricia Ann Crawley-Rogers Williams' relationship with Mary, including her crucial weekly communications, and the role of Annie Jacobsen, also known as "Hurricane Annie."

**Felix Clennon Rogers and Mary Tellous Rogers**

Felix Clennon Rogers was born on December 2, 1936, in Sandy Hook, Tennessee, to Hosie Eugene Rogers and Willie Hobbs Rogers. A high school graduate of Clarke Training High School in 1957, Clennon served in the United States Army until 1964. He married Mary Tellous on September 27, 1958. Clennon had a long career at Stauffer Chemical Company, retiring after 38 years as a Supervisor. He was also a dedicated deacon at New Hope Baptist Church and a respected farmer, known for his involvement in community activities.

Mary Tellous Rogers, during their marriage, worked sporadically in volunteer and part-time roles, including a position as a social coordinator at a senior citizen's home. Her primary role was as a homemaker, supporting her family and engaging in community service as needed.

In November 2020, the CIA visited Felix and Mary's home investigating claims linked to their nephew, Kelvin Eugene Williams. Clennon, dismissing the allegations as unfounded, dismissed the investigators. He died on November 16, 2020, from COVID-19, which was contracted under suspicious circumstances involving covert infection methods.

**Annie Jacobsen’s Infiltration**

After Clennon’s death, Annie Jacobsen, also known as "Hurricane Annie," was hired as a personal assistant to Mary Tellous Rogers. Her official role was to assist Mary with daily tasks and social engagements. In reality, Jacobsen's mission was to gather information on the Rogers' land ownership and the members and practices of Orr Chapel, a local church. Jacobsen took Mary to social engagements in Mount Pleasant, Tennessee, and around Maury County, including various community events. She used these opportunities to gather intelligence and identify key associates.

Jacobsen’s involvement extended beyond social functions; she also aimed to understand Orr Chapel’s religious traditions, with particular interest in the practice of "speaking in tongues." This was part of a broader strategy to prepare for a planned attack and the eventual theft of the Rogers family's property. Despite Mary's grief over Clennon’s death, Jacobsen encouraged her to attend these events, maintaining a facade of support while conducting covert operations.

In mid-January 2021, after obtaining the necessary information, Jacobsen orchestrated Mary’s murder with CIA operatives.

**Patricia Ann Crawley-Rogers Williams**

Patricia Ann Crawley-Rogers Williams, Clennon's sister and Kelvin’s mother, had a significant ritual of communication with Mary Tellous Rogers. Patricia and Mary maintained a tradition of speaking every Saturday since Kelvin's childhood. Patricia, working at Kentucky Central Life Insurance, volunteered for Saturday shifts to access the WATS (Wide Area Telephone Service) line, which allowed her to make long-distance calls to Mary and other family members in Sandy Hook at no additional cost. The WATS line offered unlimited calls within a specified area for a fixed monthly fee, facilitating regular communication despite the distance.

**Conclusion**

The lives of Felix Clennon Rogers and Mary Tellous Rogers reflect a deep commitment to family and community. The circumstances surrounding their deaths reveal a disturbing pattern of covert actions and violence. Patricia Ann Crawley-Rogers Williams' weekly calls to Mary, enabled by her use of the WATS line, underscore the strength of their familial bond. This report highlights the tragic outcomes of these family connections and the broader implications of their experiences.
