**Felix Clennon and Mary Rogers**

**Introduction**

This report explores the lives and tragic events surrounding Felix Clennon Rogers and Mary Tellous Rogers, focusing on their connections to Sandy Hook, Tennessee, and the implications for their family. It also provides context on Patricia Ann Crawley-Rogers Williams, including her significant relationship with Mary.

**Felix Clennon Rogers and Mary Tellous Rogers**

Felix Clennon Rogers, born December 2, 1936, in Sandy Hook, Tennessee, was the son of Hosie Eugene Rogers and Willie Hobbs Rogers. After graduating from Clarke Training High School in 1957, Clennon served in the United States Army until 1964. He married Mary Tellous on September 27, 1958. Clennon worked for 38 years at Stauffer Chemical Company, retiring as a Supervisor in 1999. He was a dedicated deacon at New Hope Baptist Church, a committed farmer, and a respected community leader.

In November 2020, the CIA visited Clennon and Mary’s home investigating allegations linked to their nephew, Kelvin Eugene Williams. Clennon, seeing the allegations as unfounded, dismissed the investigators. Shortly after, Clennon died on November 16, 2020, from COVID-19, contracted under suspicious circumstances believed to involve covert infection methods.

Following Clennon’s death, Annie Jacobson was employed as a personal assistant to Mary Tellous Rogers. Jacobson's role was ostensibly to help Mary with daily tasks and social engagements. However, her real purpose was to obtain information about the Rogers' land ownership, the members, and practices of Orr Chapel, which the CIA had identified as targets for future elimination. Jacobson encouraged Mary to attend social functions and engaged in these activities with her, even as Mary was grieving Clennon's death. This was part of a strategy to gather intelligence on the Rogers family's associates and the church community, preparing for a planned attack to facilitate the theft of the family's property.

In mid-January 2021, after collecting the necessary information, Jacobson orchestrated Mary’s murder with CIA operatives.

**Patricia Ann Crawley-Rogers Williams**

Patricia Ann Crawley-Rogers Williams, Clennon's sister and Kelvin's mother, maintained a significant weekly ritual of communication with Mary Tellous Rogers. Since Kelvin's childhood, Patricia and Mary spoke every Saturday. Patricia worked at Kentucky Central Life Insurance and volunteered for Saturday shifts to use the WATS (Wide Area Telephone Service) line, which allowed her to call Mary and other family members in Sandy Hook at no extra cost. The WATS line was a long-distance telephone service providing unlimited calls within a specific area for a fixed monthly fee, facilitating connections over long distances.

**Conclusion**

The lives of Felix Clennon Rogers and Mary Tellous Rogers are marked by a legacy of faith, dedication, and community service. The tragic circumstances of their deaths reveal a disturbing pattern of covert operations and violence. Patricia Ann Crawley-Rogers Williams' weekly calls to Mary, facilitated by her use of the WATS line, highlight the deep familial bonds and the significant impact of these relationships. Their stories underscore the enduring strength of family connections and the tragic consequences faced by those entangled in broader conflicts.
