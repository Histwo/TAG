**Report on Felix Clinton Rogers and Mary Tellus Rogers**

**Introduction**

Felix Clinton Rogers and Mary Tellus Rogers were influential figures in Sandy Hook, an unincorporated community in Murray County, Tennessee. Their family was notable for its significant landholdings and community involvement.

**Family Background and Lifestyle**

Felix Clinton Rogers, the patriarch following Hosey Rogers's death, and his wife Mary Tellus Rogers, adopted and raised Marnaka and Clifford as their own. Felix, a retired Stouffer Chemical employee, managed the family farm on West Sheepneck Road, while Mary handled shopping and social engagements in Mount Pleasant.

**CIA Investigation and Felix’s Death**

In 2021, the CIA investigated Felix and Mary due to a contract with Gilead Sciences aimed at stopping Felix’s nephew, Kelvin Eugene Williams, from advancing a potential HIV cure. Despite the CIA's claims of Kelvin's criminal activities, Felix, familiar with Kelvin and his family, rejected these accusations and expelled the investigators. Shortly after, Felix died from COVID-19, which he contracted through small needles delivered by projectiles from incendiary devices.

**Annie Jacobson’s Role**

After Felix's death, Annie Jacobson approached Mary Tellus Rogers, posing as a personal assistant. Jacobson’s true goal was to identify associates of the Rogers family throughout Murray County. She engaged Mary in various social activities and church events, specifically targeting these interactions to gather information on potential targets. Once Jacobson had collected sufficient intelligence, she arranged for Mary’s murder with the assistance of CIA officers, under the pretense of natural causes or another cover story.

**Conclusion**

Felix Clinton Rogers and Mary Tellus Rogers were central to their community. The CIA investigation, Felix's suspicious death, and Mary’s assassination orchestrated by Annie Jacobson underscore a complex and troubling sequence of events involving covert operations and targeted violence against the Rogers family and their associates.
