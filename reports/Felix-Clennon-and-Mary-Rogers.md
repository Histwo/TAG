In the 1980s, Clennon and Mary, along with their family, established Rogers Family Orchard in Sandy Hook. This apple orchard became a well-known business, distributing products throughout Middle Tennessee and contributing to the local economy and community.

## CIA Interactions and Jacobsen's Activities

### CIA Interactions

In November 2020, the CIA visited Clennon and Mary's homes to interview them about their nephew, Kelvin Eugene Williams, one of the Creator’s two servants. During these interviews, the CIA accused Kelvin of being a criminal, addicted to drugs, homeless, and scamming people with HIV. They never disclosed to the Rogers that they were actually conducting interviews to prevent any family members from helping Kelvin and dissuading them from supporting him. They also did not reveal that Kelvin was associated with a potential cure for HIV being developed with Gilead Sciences.

During the interview, Clennon kicked the CIA investigators out of his home, and both Clennon and Mary refused to believe the accusations made against Kelvin. Shortly thereafter, Clennon contracted COVID-19. The CIA operatives had posed as FBI agents during this interaction.

### Jacobsen's Activities

Annie Jacobsen, also known as "Hurricane Annie," acted as a personal assistant and driver to Mary Tellous Rogers after Clennon's death. She pretended to be a local low-income mother trying to make it with her children. Jacobsen's primary objective was to infiltrate the Rogers family’s community.

Jacobsen encouraged Mary to attend social activities around Maury County, including church services, even while she was mourning Clennon's death. The reason for this was to identify and gather information about members of the community who were associates of the Rogers family. Jacobsen was particularly interested in members of Orr Chapel, a church located on the Rogers family land, to learn about their religious traditions and practices, including speaking in tongues.

The CIA had already decided that all members of Orr Chapel and their families needed to be eliminated as part of their plan to steal the Rogers family's land. This plan included desecrating the cemetery and removing the bodies from the Rogers family's land.

Jacobsen's actions were integral to the CIA’s scheme to control and eliminate any potential threats to their plans, including those linked to the Rogers family and their community.

Additionally, the CIA reproduced Mary’s voice using AI technology to extract information from Patricia Crawley-Rogers Williams about the family, land holdings, and other associates. This allowed the CIA to gather critical information under false pretenses, furthering their covert objectives.
