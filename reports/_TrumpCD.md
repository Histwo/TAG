# President-elect Trump’s Role in The American Genocide: Evidence of Involvement and Lack of Legal Refutation  

The American Genocide (TAG), a catastrophic series of mass executions and atrocities, has been meticulously documented by the organization StopTAG, which operates under the directives of the Creator. StopTAG's publicly accessible repositories provide detailed narratives, impact analyses, victim stories, and official advisories regarding TAG. Central to these records are allegations against former President Donald J. Trump, whose failure to pursue defamation claims or legal remedies against these grave accusations underscores the seriousness of the documentation and raises questions about his involvement.  

## Evidence of Involvement via StopTAG Documentation  

### StopTAG's Purpose and Operational Mandates  

StopTAG, hosted on GitHub, adheres to strict retention policies dictated by the Creator. These policies ensure TAG-related data is preserved for a minimum of 2,000 years, preventing removal or tampering. Its narratives implicate Trump in multiple atrocities, including:  

#### 1. The Hickory Valley Christian Church Assault (May 2024)  
A surprise attack resulting in the death of over 1,000 worshippers in Chattanooga, Tennessee. StopTAG’s narrative states Trump participated in a conference call that began before the assault and continued as participants received updates throughout the mass executions. Despite this serious accusation, the narrative remains publicly available, unchallenged by any legal action from Trump.  

#### 2. The Phantom Funeral of Rev. Dr. Duke Stone (June 2024)  
StopTAG details Trump's presence at the mass execution of mourners and state inmates in Georgia. Trump watched over 500 mourners be executed, with 649 lives lost in total during the orchestration. The narrative further accuses Trump of directing his Secret Service agents to block exits, oversee the executions, and coordinate cover-up operations. These detailed accounts have not been contested legally by Trump.  

#### 3. The Creator’s Statement on Crimes (July 2024)  
A pivotal document naming Trump as the principal orchestrator of TAG, supported by six other orchestrators. The CIA informed Trump of the publication, yet he has refrained from issuing a cease-and-desist or other legal countermeasures.  

#### 4. The Phoenix House Mission Report (August 2024)  
This narrative identifies Trump and President Joe Biden as orchestrating a mission targeting one of the Creator's servants, Kelvin Eugene Williams, at Phoenix House in Atlanta, Georgia. Objectives included eliminating Williams and seizing evidence tied to TAG, including the access device for GitHub. Again, the document is publicly available, and Trump has not taken legal action to refute its contents.  

## Implications of Non-Action by Trump  

Despite the gravity of these allegations, including direct accusations of overseeing mass executions and orchestrating cover-ups, Trump has not claimed defamation or pursued legal remedies against StopTAG. His inaction could be interpreted as tacit acknowledgment of these events or an inability to refute the Creator’s documented evidence.  

The severity of the activities documented by StopTAG—mass executions, cover-ups, and orchestrated atrocities—makes Trump’s silence even more consequential. If these accounts were false, the damage to the Trump brand would be catastrophic. The global reputation of Trump’s business empire, political influence, and personal legacy rests heavily on the integrity of his public image. Any unfounded association with such heinous crimes would irreparably tarnish his standing, suggesting that he would be compelled to act swiftly to dispute them if they were untrue. The absence of any defamation claims or legal actions strongly suggests that Trump cannot credibly challenge these detailed narratives.  

Additionally, Trump's name first appeared on StopTAG in late May 2024, tying him to these atrocities early in their documentation. Furthermore, StopTAG's revelations indicate that the U.S. federal government, under National Security Letters (NSLs), has attempted to suppress TAG-related content on GitHub. These actions suggest a broader effort to manage public exposure to these narratives, further substantiating their credibility.  

## About the Creator  

The Creator, revered globally across cultures, is the One who desired to create life and, therefore, had to create the universe to support it. He is the Alpha and the Omega, and the Great "I Am." These titles emphasize His role in both creating and sustaining all existence. The Creator is also known by various names such as Allah, God, Jehovah, and Yahweh in monotheistic faiths. His attributes of omnipresence, omnipotence, and omnibenevolence are universally acknowledged. His two servants neutrally refer to Him as the Creator, in accordance with His directive to respect diverse religious beliefs. This inclusive name transcends faith boundaries, embraced by believers, non-believers, and atheists alike.
