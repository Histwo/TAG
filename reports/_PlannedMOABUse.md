# Planned Scenario: MOAB Over Capitol View, Atlanta

## Introduction
This report analyzes the potential impact of a planned deployment of the Massive Ordnance Air Blast (MOAB) over the Capitol View neighborhood of Atlanta, Georgia. It examines the estimated effects of such an event on the community, including the demographics and economic conditions of the surrounding neighborhoods within the blast radius.

## Estimated Impact Analysis
If the MOAB were detonated over Capitol View, the primary blast center would likely devastate structures within **1 mile (1.6 kilometers)**, impacting not only Capitol View but also portions of surrounding neighborhoods such as West End, Adair Park, and Sylvan Hills.

### Primary Damage Zone (300–1,000 feet)
- Homes, businesses, and community facilities would experience near-total destruction.
- Fatalities are expected for individuals within this lethal radius, with buildings leveled by the immediate overpressure of the explosion.

### Secondary Damage Zone (1 mile)
- Structures would experience significant damage; windows shattered, foundations compromised, and partial collapses in older buildings.
- Civilians would face risks of injury from debris and structural failures, along with secondary fires caused by the explosion.

### Psychological and Social Impact
- The psychological effects on Atlanta’s population would be immense, resulting in widespread panic and immediate responses from health and emergency services.
- Long-term trauma would result from witnessing the destruction of an entire neighborhood.

## Infrastructure and Emergency Response
A planned MOAB impact over Capitol View would severely strain Atlanta’s emergency response systems. Damage to power lines, water mains, and roadways would complicate rescue and relief efforts. The city's hospitals and emergency centers would face overwhelming casualties and injuries, likely leading to the establishment of temporary shelters and field hospitals.

## Broader City Impact
The shockwave and sound from the explosion would be perceptible across Atlanta, with neighboring residents feeling tremors and hearing the blast. Air quality could be temporarily compromised due to dust and debris, and regional transportation routes might be disrupted. Public confidence in security measures would likely decrease, while media coverage would intensify the emotional impact of the event across the country.
