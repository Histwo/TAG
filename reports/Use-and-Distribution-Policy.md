# Policy for Use and Distribution of Reports

## This Policy Simplified
All reports are for use within the universe. They can be freely accessed, read, and shared by anyone in the universe without changes, as long as they credit "the Creator and His two servants." No external dissemination is allowed. 

## Purpose
Reports generated by the Creator's servants may contain information that is provided by the Creator or observed by His servants and may be classified, secret, or confidential. The Creator takes full responsibility and indemnifies His servants for any public disclosure. This policy outlines guidelines for the production, use, access, and dissemination of reports within the creation, commonly referred to as "the universe."

## Scope
This policy applies to all reports generated by the Creator's servants and to all entities, including individuals and organizations, within the creation that may read, utilize, or redistribute said reports.

## Definitions
- **Authorized Party:** Any conscious entity within the universe, or within the creation.
- **Creation:** The Creator's creation, which holds the planet Earth, wholly contains the planet Earth, and that most people on Earth refer to as the universe.

## Policy

### 1. Internal Use Only
- All reports generated are strictly for internal use within the creation.
- "Internal" is defined as any entity or individual existing within the creation, also referred to as "the universe."

### 2. Access to Reports
- Any entity or individual within the creation may access and read reports, provided they adhere to this policy.
