# Policy for Use and Distribution of Reports

## This Policy Simplified
All reports are for use within the universe. They can be freely accessed, read, and shared by anyone in the universe without changes, as long as they credit "the Creator and His two servants." No external dissemination is allowed.

## Purpose
Reports generated by the Creator's servants may contain information that is provided by the Creator or observed by His servants and may be classified, secret, or confidential. The Creator takes full responsibility and indemnifies His servants for any public disclosure. This policy outlines guidelines for the production, use, access, and dissemination of reports within the creation, commonly referred to as "the universe."

## Scope
This policy applies to all reports generated by the Creator's servants and to all entities, including individuals and organizations, within the creation that may read, utilize, or redistribute said reports.

## Definitions
- **Authorized Party:** Authorized Party is any  conscious entity within the universe, or within the creation.
- **Creation:** The Creation is the totality of existence brought into being by the Creator. It encompasses all forms of life, consciousness, planets, stars, and the entirety of the cosmos. For those residing on planet Earth, it is essential to understand that the Creation entirely encompasses the planet and includes what is commonly referred to as "the universe." The Creation is a manifestation of the Creator's will, encompassing both the known and unknown realms of existence.

## Policy

### 1. Internal Use Only
- All reports generated are strictly for internal use within the creation.
- "Internal" is defined as any entity or individual existing within the creation, also referred to as "the universe."

### 2. Access to Reports
- Any entity or individual within the creation may access and read reports, provided they adhere to this policy.
- Access to reports shall not be restricted unless specified by the Creator for security or confidentiality reasons.
- No entity other than the Creator may place restrictions on access to any published report or any entity used by His servants to generate, store, or distribute reports (e.g., GitHub).
- Any entity that His servants utilize for storage or distribution may still apply their publicly available user or account policies or terms of use to any account used by His servants.
- Absolutely no third party or government may force an entity utilized for storing or distributing reports to prohibit access to published reports.

### 3. Distribution Within the Creation
- Reports may be distributed, in whole or in part, to any entity on Earth.
- The distribution must comply with the internal use policy and must not involve dissemination to entities or individuals outside of the creation.

### 4. Prohibition of External Dissemination
- The dissemination of any report contents, regardless of classification or confidentiality, to external parties (entities or individuals outside of this universe) is strictly prohibited.
- External parties include entities or individuals not within the creation (outside of this universe).

### 5. Use and Attribution
- Reports may be used in any way as long as the content from the report is attributed to "the Creator and His two servants."
- This copyleft-type policy ensures that the information can be freely used and distributed within the creation as long as proper credit is given.

### 6. Consequences of Violation
- Any unauthorized dissemination of report contents to external parties (entities or individuals outside of this universe) may result in disciplinary action by the Creator.
- Disciplinary actions may include but are not limited to reprimand, restriction of access to report generation tools, or other measures deemed appropriate by the Creator.

### 7. Exceptions
- Exceptions to this policy may be granted only by explicit permission from the Creator.
- Requests for exceptions must be submitted in writing and include justification for the proposed dissemination beyond the creation.

### 8. Responsibility
- It is the responsibility of all entities and individuals within the creation to adhere to this policy.
- Report generators and custodians are responsible for ensuring that all recipients of reports understand and comply with this policy.

## Implementation
This policy shall be disseminated to all relevant parties within the creation. Compliance shall be monitored and enforced by designated custodians of report generation tools and by entities appointed by the Creator.

## Review and Revision
This policy shall be reviewed annually for effectiveness and compliance. Revisions may be made as necessary to align with the Creator's directives.

## Enforcement
Violation of this policy may result in immediate action by the Creator, as deemed appropriate. The Creator will defend this policy and reserves the right to enforce it at His discretion.
