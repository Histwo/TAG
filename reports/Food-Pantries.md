# The Weaponization of Food Pantries During The American Genocide (TAG)

## Introduction
During The American Genocide (TAG), food pantries were weaponized to lure vulnerable individuals into mass killing operations. These pantries served two primary functions: some were food-providing operations, offering counterfeit food to deceive victims, while others were directly involved in mass killings. The food-providing pantries, though rare, were critical in advancing the genocidal agenda. In contrast, the killing food pantries were death traps where no one seeking help ever left alive.

## 1. The Setting: Masquerade Churches and Properties of Previous Assaults
Food pantries were hosted at masquerade churchesâ€”locations established to mimic legitimate places of worship but, in reality, served as fronts for orchestrating mass killings. These churches were built on the properties of congregations that had already been subjected to violent surprise assaults during weekly worship services, resulting in the massacre of all those present.

| Church                         | Location            |
|--------------------------------|---------------------|
| Hickory Valley Christian Church | Chattanooga, TN     |
| Mount Zion Baptist Church       | Georgetown, KY      |

These sites were initially attacked, and all worshippers present were killed. Those absent during the attacks were later tracked down and eliminated through targeted killings. To conceal these actions, perpetrators employed illegal body disposal methods, such as dissolution and grinding, ensuring victims vanished without a trace.

## 2. The Function of Food Pantries as Tools of Violence
Food pantries served primarily as tools for advancing mass killings. These operations were designed to lure in vulnerable populations under the false pretense of offering aid. No one seeking assistance from these pantries escaped alive. However, food pantries existed in two distinct forms during TAG: food-providing pantries and killing food pantries.

### 2.1 Killing Food Pantries: The Deadly Trap
The vast majority of food pantries during TAG were killing food pantries. These operations were designed solely to trap individuals, leading them into mass killing scenarios.

- **Method:** Once individuals arrived at these food pantries, they were systematically killed in large numbers. The pantries were camouflaged as charitable efforts, with food offered as a lure. However, the true nature of these operations was a calculated mass murder strategy, and no one who entered these pantries ever left alive.

### 2.2 Food-Providing Pantries: Deceptive Relief
Food-providing pantries were rare but played a pivotal role in the perpetrators' strategy. These pantries appeared to offer genuine relief, providing food to the impoverished. However, the food was counterfeit and tainted, unsafe for human consumption. Despite being presented as higher-quality food, often packaged in counterfeit brands, the offerings were lethal and designed to kill.

- **Function:** These pantries were not merely about providing food but about manipulating victims and maintaining control over public perception. They were designed to reduce or eliminate discussions about the disappearances of victims from killing pantries and to support word-of-mouth campaigns that lured more individuals into these deadly traps.

## 3. Transportation
TAG perpetrators used passenger vans and school buses to transport those seeking assistance from surrounding communities, often traveling up to 100 miles to the location of the operation. This transportation was offered as an additional deceptive measure to increase access to victims and ensure larger numbers at the killing sites.

## 4. Benefits Fraud by CIA
One of the most insidious aspects of the operation was the benefits fraud perpetuated by the CIA. After the deaths of victims, many were registered for various state and federal assistance programs, with the benefits being rerouted to enrich the agency. This practice not only added another layer of exploitation to the tragedy but also ensured a financial incentive for maintaining and expanding these operations.

## 5. Food Pantry Operations
The following table provides a list of food pantry operations, documenting the details of each operation, including the church involved, operational dates, operatives, transportation used, and the number of victims affected.

| Church                         | Dates                | Operatives   | Transportation        | Victims   |
