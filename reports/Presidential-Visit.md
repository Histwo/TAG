# **Top-Secret Presidential Mission to Phoenix House**

## **Introduction**

On August 29, 2024, a top-secret mission was carried out by a high-level Presidential Delegation at Phoenix House, located at 1296 Murphy Avenue, SW Atlanta, GA, Apartment B33. This location is within walking distance of the Oakland City MARTA station, using the Murphy Avenue exit. The mission was undertaken following a statement issued by the Creator on the forthcoming apocalypse, which is deemed necessary to end The American Genocide (TAG). Although officially presented as a national security matter, the true purpose of the visit was to oversee the elimination of one of the Creator's two servants, who resides at this address, and to suppress any reporting on TAG.

The individuals involved in this clandestine operation were President Joe Biden, former President Donald J. Trump, Annie "Hurricane Annie" Jacobsen, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY), and CIA Director William Burns. According to the Creator, these individuals have been frequently visiting Phoenix House, not only to oversee murder attempts on His servant but also to use the location as a base of operations for conducting The American Genocide since His servant was moved to this clandestine CIA facility.

Details of this mission were provided to one of the Creator's servants by the Creator Himself and have been made public. This disclosure, once revealed by the Creator or His servants, is considered declassified regardless of prior security designations. This report is also consistent with the Creator’s current policy regarding the disclosure of information concerning TAG.

## **Objectives**

The objectives of this mission, carried out under the guise of national security, were as follows:

- **Eliminate His Servant**:  
   The delegation's primary objective was to eliminate Kelvin Eugene Williams, one of the Creator's two servants and the only user who can administer, update, or modify the StopTAG organization and TAG repository on GitHub. Williams resides at Phoenix House, in an apartment provided by a CIA front. Despite numerous elimination attempts, he has survived due to the Creator’s protection.

- **Eliminate TAG Reporting**:  
   The delegation aimed to gain access to user accounts (by using stolen credentials and/or devices) that have posted critical information about the acts committed by the perpetrators of TAG. Once access was gained, the plan was to remove all TAG reporting. However, the Creator actively protects all of the work performed by His servants, preventing its deletion or manipulation.

- **Suppress and Discredit TAG Reporting**:  
   A secondary objective of the delegation was to render the Internet inaccessible to His servant, install malicious software, and physically destroy devices to prevent any further reports. Additionally, they orchestrated defamation campaigns and circulated irrelevant personal attacks in an effort to discredit His servant.

## **Aftermath and Decision for Escalation**

*Note: This section is based on classified information the Creator provided to His servant for this report.*

When the delegation's objectives failed due to the Creator’s active protection, frustration and urgency led to an internal realization: they were trying to eliminate one of the Creator's two servants. Following a series of meetings, they reached the decision to deploy the MOAB (Mother Of All Bombs) over Phoenix House, located in the Capitol View neighborhood of Atlanta, to eliminate the neighborhood and surrounding areas.
